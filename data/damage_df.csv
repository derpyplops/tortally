"In August of 2014, while traveling in France, Lourdes Ameziani thought she was pregnant. She bought ahome pregnancy testand the result was positive. She called her obstetrician in New York who told her to come to the office for a more definitive blood test. She flew home but woke up on the next day, August 6th, with abdominal pain and nausea before she arrived at her doctor’s office, took the blood test and was told that she was in fact pregnant.For her pain and nausea, Ms. Ameziani, then 41 years old, was given Tylenol. Later that day, at home, the pain was unrelenting so she called her doctor whose response was to go to a radiologist for an ultrasound and sonograms. An ectopic pregnancy was ruled out but severe pain especially on the right side continued. Unknown at this point was that Ms. Ameziani had aninflamed appendix. She was advised to go to the emergency room if her pain got worse.That night, still in tremendous pain, she called her doctor’s office and the on call doctor told her on the phone that it sounds like appendicitis and she should call an ambulance. She did and was admitted to the hospital where herappendix rupturedlater that night requiring emergency laparoscopic surgery in which the doctors found peritonitis, gangrene and an infection.In her ensuing medical malpracticelawsuit against her obstetrician and the radiologist,plaintiff claimed that the delayed diagnosis increased the severity of the injury from mere appendicitis to a perforated appendix that required extensive surgery, an extended hospital stay, much more and continuing pain and an early miscarriage of the baby.The Manhattan jury ruled that both doctors were at fault. Plaintiff was also found to be at fault for not going to the emergency room sooner. Before apportionment (30% to the obstetrician, 41% to the radiologist and 29% to plaintiff), the jury awardedpain and suffering damages in the sum of $725,000(all past – seven years).Neither defendant challenged the award as excessive and thedefendant obstetrician settled with plaintiff after the verdict.Theradiologist appealed, though, arguing that even if her sonogram report did not rule out the possibility of appendicitis, that was not a substantial factor in causing the delayed diagnosis and resulting injuries.

The Richmond County jury found that the city was negligent in not providing training to lifeguards with regard to this tragic incident ofshallow water blackout(which occurs if a swimmer repeatedly hyperventilates and then holds his breath).

"On March 21, 2009,  43-year-old Gloria Boniladied as a result of injuries sustained in a fire at the Riverview IRA, a state-run home for mentally disabled individuals in Wells, New York.The Riverview IRA fire scene.A claim against the state was filed on behalf of Ms. Bonila seeking damages. Claimant was granted and an appellate court affirmedsummary judgment on liability. The mater then proceeded to a trial on damages following which the Court of Claims judge awarded$4,000,000 for 3 1/2 hours of pre-death pain and suffering. The case was appealed because the parties disagreed on the amount of post-judgment interest to be added to the pain and suffering award.InDavila v. State of New York(3rd Dept. 2020), the appellate court affirmed the lower court’s determnination as to the amount and manner of calculating post-judgment interest. The award thus stood at $5,350,000 ($4,000,000 for pre-death pain and suffering, $1,299,000 for pre-judgment ineterst and $51,000 for post-judgment interest).Ms. Bonilla was a long time resident of the home functioning in the profound range of mental retardation. She was non-verbal and not self-preserving, meaning she could not get herself out of harm’s way. After a fire alarm was activated at 5:25 a.m. on the morning of the fire, Ms. Bonilla was escorted from her bedroom to a mudroom but was never evacuated from there in time to save her life.

New York City Transit Authority(2d Dept. 2019).The appellate court decision did not at all mention the injuries sustained by the then 37 year old Ms. Barrett.Here are the injury details:ankle sprainright shoulder rotator cuff tearand impingement, requiring arthroscopic surgery to repairleft shoulder impingement, requiring arthroscopic surgeryright wrist triangular fibrocartilage complex tear, requiring open surgery to repair with anchorslumbar radiculopathy and chronic neck pain, requiring epidural injectionsdepression and anxietyPlaintiff’s damages case was bolstered by medical expertsincluding her orthopedic surgeon, pain management doctor and psychologist who testified that (a) all of her injuries were caused by the accident, (b) plaintiff’s mobility loss in her shoulders and wrist are permanent and therefore it’s unlikely she could ever return to full time work (she’d been a financial analyst), (c) plaintiff continues to suffer from pain in her neck, back, shoulders and foot requiring ongoing medication and physical therapy and (d) objective tests demonstrated plaintiff’s significant depressive and anxiety disorders (her psychologist stated that her inability to return to work “was one of the great stressors in her life”).The defendant argued that plaintiff’s many injuries were not caused by the accident, noting that at the scene, in the ambulance and at the hospital emergency room, she only complained about right ankle pain and swelling and that it wasn’t until she saw a doctor at a “therapy place” five days later that she  complained about her shoulders, wrist and spine.The defense contended that the case was about “a simple stumble and sprained ankle.”Three months before the accident, Ms. Barrett had been hired by JP Morgan Chase as a financial associate/officer. Her salary was <redacted> with full benefits and eligibility for a bonus. She never returned to work. She did, though, start graduate classes in September of 2009 for two semesters and applied, unsuccessfully, to return to her prior job.Inside Information:Theonly doctor who testified for the defense was a neurologistwho had conducted a no-fault examination in July 2007. He made it clear that he examined plaintiff only “interested in neurologic issues”, not her multiple orthopedic injuries. The defense had plaintiff examined by an orthopedist but did not call him to testify at trial.Plaintiff’s orthopedic surgeon testified that even thoughshe never fell to the ground, she tore her rotator cuffs when she fell forwardwhile holding the door rail: “[t]he power or the weight and the momentum behind her of moving forward is being restrained by her hands behind her and that puts a lot of stress in the front of your shoulders.”",107,3457

"On February 13, 2009, at 5 a.m., Anthony Shimukonas was asleep in his East Harlem apartment when he was awakened by what sounded like an explosion. It was a squad of officers from the New York CityPolice Department forcibly breaching and ramming through the door to execute a no knock search warrantbased upon information that Mr. Shimukonas was in possession of illegal drugs and guns.In the ensuing moments, after the leadofficer approached him with a four foot long, two foot wide bullet resistant shield, the 23 year old Shimukonas was handcuffed and arrested.In the melee, Shimukonas sustained abroken nose. He was taken to the local emergency room for minor treatment before he was booked at the police station and taken to the prison at Rikers Island. He ultimately pled guilty to various crimes and spent eight years in jail.Shimukonas sued the police department claiming that the officers used excessive force during the arrest and that as a result he was injured. In early 2018, a Manhattanjury agreed that the force was excessive but they declined to award any compensation at all for either past or future pain and suffering.Plaintiff appealed and inShimukonas v. City of New York(1st Dept. 2019), the court ruled that the jury’s failure to award damages forpastpain and suffering was contrary to a fair interpretation of the evidence and deviated from what would be reasonable compensation.The appellate court ordered an increase in pain and suffering damages to the sum of$200,000(all past – nine years). The award of zero damages forfuturepain and suffering was not disturbed.The court’s decision indicated that plaintiff sustained  a broken nose and orbital fractures. Here are theinjury details:traumatic nasal deformity – significant deviation of one side of bony dorsum with valve collapsefacial lacerations requiring stitchesopen rhinoplasty (reconstructive nasal surgery) with osteotomy, dorsal spreader graft and alar rim graftNo doctors testified for either side; instead, the parties agreed that there would be no need for medical testimony. Records from the emergency room on the date of the incident and from the hospital where plaintiff underwent surgery five months later were accepted as trial exhibits.Plaintiff testified that for two weeks after the incident he could not see out of one eye, had difficulty breathing and lost his sense of smell. He claimed at trial that his major remaining complaint was that he still had no sense of smell (except for brief intervals, about one day a month).Inside Information:There is no mention of any orbital fracture in the medical records.When the police entered plaintiff’as apartment, he did indeed have guns – anAK-47 assault rifle in his bed and a loaded Glock 9 MM handgun on his nightstand. While there was no claim that plaintiff grabbed either weapon, the police claimed they used the shield to pin the plaintiff against a wall because he stood up, was moving around and disobeyed their commands to lay down on the floor,Plaintiff’s pre-trialsettlement demandwas $25,000.

He ultimately pled guilty to various crimes and spent eight years in jail.Shimukonas sued the police department claiming that the officers used excessive force during the arrest and that as a result he was injured. In early 2018, a Manhattanjury agreed that the force was excessive but they declined to award any compensation at all for either past or future pain and suffering.Plaintiff appealed and inShimukonas v. City of New York(1st Dept. 2019), the court ruled that the jury’s failure to award damages forpastpain and suffering was contrary to a fair interpretation of the evidence and deviated from what would be reasonable compensation.The appellate court ordered an increase in pain and suffering damages to the sum of<redacted>(all past – nine years). The award of zero damages forfuturepain and suffering was not disturbed.The court’s decision indicated that plaintiff sustained  a broken nose and orbital fractures. Here are theinjury details:traumatic nasal deformity – significant deviation of one side of bony dorsum with valve collapsefacial lacerations requiring stitchesopen rhinoplasty (reconstructive nasal surgery) with osteotomy, dorsal spreader graft and alar rim graftNo doctors testified for either side; instead, the parties agreed that there would be no need for medical testimony. Records from the emergency room on the date of the incident and from the hospital where plaintiff underwent surgery five months later were accepted as trial exhibits.Plaintiff testified that for two weeks after the incident he could not see out of one eye, had difficulty breathing and lost his sense of smell. He claimed at trial that his major remaining complaint was that he still had no sense of smell (except for brief intervals, about one day a month).Inside Information:There is no mention of any orbital fracture in the medical records.When the police entered plaintiff’as apartment, he did indeed have guns – anAK-47 assault rifle in his bed and a loaded Glock 9 MM handgun on his nightstand.

The jury also awardedpunitive damages in the sum of $500,000.InFeldman v. Knack(2d Dept. 2019), the awards have all been affirmed.Plaintiff testified at length concerning the significant emotional and psychological pain and suffering she endured as a result of her being raped by her psychologist. For example, she stated:“I feel like not just my body was raped but my soul was raped. I feel dismantled, in that everything that makes you feel like you’re human is gone. I don’t feel alive. My life has never been easy but going to someone for help and having that person betray me in such a brutal way. I have recurrent nightmares. Horrible nightmares. I’m afraid of everything.”Ms. Feldman further testified that she’d relapsed into alcohol abuse, doesn’t trust anyone anymore, doesn’t go out ever, totally isolated herself and doesn’t cook or bake anymore.Ms. Feldman described her lifelong experiences with abusiveness which included being raped by her father each week until she left home when she was eight and a half years old, being sexually abused by her brother and her father’s shooting to death of her brother.

"In May 2008, after receiving a tip that a 44 year old woman had attempted to engage a child in sexual activity, New York State Police troopers executed a search warrant for evidence related to child pornography at the Albany home the woman shared with her 24 year old son Robert Partridge. During the execution of the warrant, Mr. Partridge was arrested on drug-related charges for the criminal possession of steroids. The charges were dismissed in November 2008.Although Mr. Partridge was never suspected of or charged with any sexual crime against a child, on June 17, 2008, hisphotograph was displayed and disseminated during a press conference conducted by the State Police educating parents and children about online sexual predators. The conference was covered by five local television stations and was also made available for online streaming on various websites.Partridge filed a claim against the state seeking damages for defamation for being wrongfully branded a sexual predatorand on October 4, 2013, the Court of Claims found that the defendant was 100% liable for the defamation of Mr. Partridge. On June 9, 2017, at the conclusion of the damages trial, the samejudge awarded claimant damages in the sum of $300,000.Both sides appealed and inPartridge v. State of New York(3rd Dept. 2019), both the liability verdict and the damages award have beenaffirmed.Seven years before the press conference, Mr. Partridge was involved in a car crash that left his girlfriend dead and him in jail for two years. Also, due to the crash, he sustained a traumatic brain injury (“TBI”) that made it difficult for him to process information or keep things in his working memory to deal with them at a normal rate of speed. He underwent mental health treatment (that continued up to and following the time of his defamation) and, as late as November 2007, was treating for severe anger, anxiety and paranoia.After being defamed, Mr. Partridge no longer held a job (and did not seek new employment), broke up with his girlfriend, cut himself off from his friends, lost his self confidence, became socially withdrawn and suffered fromnew and increased paranoia and psychotic depression, constantly fearful that if he tried to date or applied for a job, people would look him up online and conclude he is a pedophile.The defendant argued that the trial proof was insufficient to allow the judge to determine to what extent claimant’s complaints were attributable to the 2008 defamation as opposed to his longstanding and well documented TBI. Claimant conceded he’d sustained a significant injury in 2001 and had undergone treatment for it but he noted that thereafter he’d been able to maintain gainful full time employment (as a leader of hiking expeditions for children and an employment trainer for people with disabilities), had significant social relationships with friends and a romantic relationship with a woman.Testimony was adduced from claimant’s treating psychiatrist and social worker as well as from his friends that, as a result of being falsely identified by the State Police as a sexual predator (a) he was humiliated, shamed and in great despair and (b) his preexisting mental health deficits were aggravated and exacerbated.Inside Information:Claimant was unable to testify at the damages trial due to severe anxiety; instead, his examinations before trial were received in evidence  in lieu of his live testimony.Defendant did not adduce any expert testimony.This was a long and hard fought case with the State represented by itsAttorney Generaland plaintiff by one of the capitol region’s most respected firms,LaFave, Wein & Frament.",300000,"In May 2008, after receiving a tip that a 44 year old woman had attempted to engage a child in sexual activity, New York State Police troopers executed a search warrant for evidence related to child pornography at the Albany home the woman shared with her 24 year old son Robert Partridge.

Edward had severe congenital scoliosis which the procedure,anterior thoracolumbar fusion from T-9 through L-1, was intended to correct. It was a complicated case that required the placement of screws and rods at several levels.

"On April 20, 2011, Thomas Tornatore, then 51 years old, was wrestling with his nephew when he sustained an injury to the base of his neck. Five days later, Mr. Tornatore sought treatment from a chiropractor.

Within a week, he was diagnosed by an orthopedic surgeon and told he had a herniated disc and needed spinal surgery.In his ensuing medical malpractice lawsuit against the chiropractor, Mr. Tornatore claimed that the manipulations were inappropriate because plaintiff suffered from pre-existing conditions, including a degenerative cervical spine with spinal stenosis.

"On September 3, 2013, at about 11 p.m., William Tyrellfell down an exterior concrete 16 step staircaseat 243 Vrooman Avenue, a two story, two apartment rental building in Amsterdam, New York. Mr. Tyrell, then 77 years old, had been visiting the upstairs tenant. He wasfound at the bottom of the staircase, unconscious.There were no witnesses to the fall.243 Vrooman Avenue, Amsterdam, NYMr. Tyrell was rushed by ambulance to the local hospital where he was conscious upon admission and diagnosed with the followinginjuries:basilar skull fracturesubdural cranial hematomacerebral hemorrhagefractured occipital boneWithin a few hours, Mr. Tyrell was transferred by ambulance to Ellis Hospital in Schenectady because his head injuries required a higher level of care than the local hospital could provide. There, he suffered seizures and acraniotomy was performed to alleviate the hematoma. He was placed on a ventilator and then in a chemically induced coma. Unsuccessful weaning from the intubation resulted in a tracheostomy about a month after the fall.On October 11, 2013, Mr. Tyrrell was transferred to Pathways, a rehabilitation facility in Niskayuna. He returned to Ellis Hospital from Pathways to deal with critical health issues on three occasions in the next three months and again on January 5, 2014, when hedied from his severe brain injuries.Two months before Mr. Tyrell’s death, he commenced a lawsuit against the building owner claiming he fell because the staircase was defective, dangerous, improperly repaired in the past, non-code compliant and deteriorated with missing or broken chunks on several different steps.  There wasno opportunity to take Mr. Tyrell’s depositionbecause his ability to communicate was seriously compromised while he was lethargic, intubated, in a coma and once his tracheostomy was performed.The action was tried in Fulton County and the jury rendered its verdict on January 13, 2017 finding that defendant was negligent and awardingpain and suffering damages in the sum of $325,000 (four months).The defendant appealed challenging the verdict as being unsupported by sufficient evidence, arguing that plaintiff could not establish the cause and location of decedent’s fall and, therefore, any finding of causation would have been improperly based upon speculation. InTyrell v.

Mr. Tyrell, then 77 years old, had been visiting the upstairs tenant. He wasfound at the bottom of the staircase, unconscious.There were no witnesses to the fall.243 Vrooman Avenue, Amsterdam, NYMr. Tyrell was rushed by ambulance to the local hospital where he was conscious upon admission and diagnosed with the followinginjuries:basilar skull fracturesubdural cranial hematomacerebral hemorrhagefractured occipital boneWithin a few hours, Mr. Tyrell was transferred by ambulance to Ellis Hospital in Schenectady because his head injuries required a higher level of care than the local hospital could provide. There, he suffered seizures and acraniotomy was performed to alleviate the hematoma. He was placed on a ventilator and then in a chemically induced coma. Unsuccessful weaning from the intubation resulted in a tracheostomy about a month after the fall.On October 11, 2013, Mr. Tyrrell was transferred to Pathways, a rehabilitation facility in Niskayuna. He returned to Ellis Hospital from Pathways to deal with critical health issues on three occasions in the next three months and again on January 5, 2014, when hedied from his severe brain injuries.Two months before Mr. Tyrell’s death, he commenced a lawsuit against the building owner claiming he fell because the staircase was defective, dangerous, improperly repaired in the past, non-code compliant and deteriorated with missing or broken chunks on several different steps.  There wasno opportunity to take Mr. Tyrell’s depositionbecause his ability to communicate was seriously compromised while he was lethargic, intubated, in a coma and once his tracheostomy was performed.The action was tried in Fulton County and the jury rendered its verdict on January 13, 2017 finding that defendant was negligent and awardingpain and suffering damages in the sum of <redacted> (four months).The defendant appealed challenging the verdict as being unsupported by sufficient evidence, arguing that plaintiff could not establish the cause and location of decedent’s fall and, therefore, any finding of causation would have been improperly based upon speculation.

He specifically selected the garage to commit his crime because of its lax security and spent two hours there lurking around and looking for someone whose car he could hijack and drive to Connecticut.In 2007, Ms. Russo-Carriero’s executors commenced awrongful death lawsuit against the City of White Plains (the owner and operator of the garage).Following the trial in 2014, the Westchester County jurors determined that the city was at fault finding that (a) the incident was foreseeable, (b) the city failed to provide minimal precautionary measures to secure the garage, and, (c) the city’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing the death.The jury also found that the criminal conduct of the murderer (who was caught quickly, confessed, convicted and sent to jail for 25 years to life) wasnota substantial factor in causing Ms. Russo-Carriero’s death.

In the midst of trial, theCrown defendants settled with plaintiff for the sum of $1,550,000 plus the waiver of the workers compensation lien of about $150,000.The only defendant remaining at trial was Advanced Fleet Maintenance, Inc. which serviced the truck’s transmission six months before the accident(and had been brought into the case by Crown as a third-party defendant).The Kings County jury found that Advanced was 49.5% liable for the accident after trial evidence demonstrated that after servicing and inspecting the truck, it allowed the truck to leave its facility without a required functioning neutral interlock system.

The accident was  not witnessed but it was clear to all that thetree entered the cab from beneath the bucket and went under a safety baras Elias was moving the Bobcat forward. He waspronounced dead at the scene.In the ensuinglawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor and the company from which Elias rented the machine, Elias’s estate claimed that the Bobcat was defectively designed, unreasonably dangerous and defective because it did not incorporate  as a standard safety feature a “special applications kit” (which, with windows and a front door, would have restricted material from entering the cab). Also, they claimed the loader was defective because it was rented without adequate warnings and training for its safe use.The Queens County jury returned averdictthat the loader was defectively designed and rented without adequate warnings and liability was apportioned 25% to the manufacturer, 25% to the distributor and 50% to the equipment rental company.

(his spine surgeon) andAli Guy, M.D.(a physiatrist who prepared alife care plandetailing the expenses including many years of medical treatment, physical therapy, diagnostic testing and epidural injections, as well as future back surgery and an additional neck surgery).The only expert testimony for the defense was from orthopedic surgeonGregory Montalbano M.D.(who opined that Mr. Sehgal’s right shoulder prognosis is very good and should not be problematic in the future, he sustained at most a cervical strain or sprain rather than a herniated disc which in any event was degenerative – not traumatically induced – and he  has no permanent disability or significant limitation).Thedefense had intended to impeach plaintiff and Dr. Guy regarding the life care planby showing that plaintiff’s attorneys, by whom he was employed in a clerical position, had referred him to Dr. Guy “as part of an attempt to build up the monetary value of his claim and not for genuine medical treatment.” At the start of trial, though, thejudge granted plaintiff’s application to precludethe defense from asking Mr. Sehgal questions as to how he was referred to Dr. Guy (or his other medical providers).As to theloss of consortium claim, plaintiff, then 59 years old, testified that he’s become dependent upon his wife and others for many activities of daily living – he can no longer mow the lawn, clean the cars, vacuum the house or help his wife with cooking. Mrs. Sehgal testified that his injuries have affected “his love and affection.” The defense noted that Mr. Sehgal missed only 45 days from work due to his injuries and claimed that his condition has greatly improved and there was no evidence that he could no longer provide the benefits of marriage, including, love, companionship, society and sexual relations.Inside Information:Mrs. Sehgal claimed disc herniationsat C3-4 and L5-S1; however, the jurors determined that her injuries did not meet the serious injury threshold underInsurance  Law Section 5102(d)and they awarded her no damages. She did not appeal.Inclosing arguments, plaintiff’s attorney asked the jurors to award Mr. Sehgal <redacted> in damages for his pain and suffering and Mrs. Sehgal <redacted> for her pain and suffering plus <redacted> for her loss of consortium claim; defense counsel argued that the jurors should “not award the Sehgals anything” because neither sustained a serious injury from the accident.",173,4093

"On June 2, 2010, Rosemary McKnight was apassenger in a city buswhich rear-ended a tanker truck on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn.As a result, Ms. McKnight, then 48 years old,injured her neck and both knees.In her ensuing lawsuit against the transit authority and its driver, Ms. McKnight’s motion for summary judgment as to liability was granted in April 2011 and the case proceeded to a trial on damages only. On July 18, 2013, the Kings Countyjury awarded her total damages in the sum of $2,270,000as follows (and as set forth in theverdict sheet):$900,000 for pain and suffering ($150,000 past – three years, $750,000 future – 25 years);$480,000 for lost wages ($80,000 past, $400,000 future – 11 years); and,$890,000 for medical expenses ($190,000 past, $700,000 future – 25 years).Thedefendants appealedarguing that the awards for lost wages were excessive because, before the bus crash,plaintiff had been receiving Workers Compensation and Social Security Disability (“SSD”) benefits from a work-related accident eight years earlier. They also argued that the medical expense awards should be reduced because some of plaintiff’s bills were paid by no fault insurance. There was no challenge to the pain and suffering awards.InMcKnight v. New York City Transit Authority(2d Dept. 2017), the appellate court agreed with the defense to the extent that it ordered a$150,470 reduction of the lost wages awardsto take into account the $205 per week plaintiff had received in Workers Compensation benefits since the new accident and that she would receive in the eleven years following the verdict.UnderCPLR 4545, in personal injury lawsuits, the judge may reduce the amount of a plaintiff’s award if he finds that any element of economic loss encompassed in the award will be replaced, in whole or in part, from a collateral source. In this case, as contemplated by the statute, the judge conducted a post-trialcollateral source hearingon August 25, 2014 at which the defendants offered evidence that plaintiff’s awards for lost wages and medical expenses should be offset by the Workers Compensation and SSD benefits she had been receiving and which defendants argued she would continue to receive in the future.The trial judge declined to make any offset; however, the appellate judges disagreed and ordered the $150,470 reduction mentioned above to take into account the Workers Compensation benefits plaintiff had been receiving and, the appellate judges concluded, she would with reasonable certainty continue to receive for the eleven year period of her lost wages jury award.Ms. McKnight’s earlier accident occurred when she tried to lift a heavy patient who fell while she was a nursing assistant at a senior care facility. As a result, she sustained injuries to her right shoulder and lower back, underwent rotator cuff and lumbar fusion surgeries, was unable to continue that job after about three years of light duty accommodation and was awarded Workers Compensation and SSD benefits.At the time of her 2010 bus accident, plaintiff was preparing to re-enter the work force, having completed schooling to become a certified medical assistant. Herinjuries in the new accident included herniated discs at C4-7, a torn anterior cruciate ligament in one knee and a torn meniscus in the other and required her to undergo cervical fusion and bilateral arthroscopic knee surgeries. She contended at trial that the new accident and injuries prevented her from engaging inanynew employment.Inside Information:On the day of the bus accident, Ms. McKnight was on her way to an EKG test that was one of the last things she had to do to become and accept a job as a certified medical assistant.Plaintiff was receiving SSD benefits of $1,080 per month for herself and $470 per month for her twin children (the kids’ benefit ended a month before the collateral source hearing).

"Denise Rivera began working for United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) in 2001 at a facility in the Bronx. She was promoted several times, eventually to a supervisor position in 2004. Shortly thereafter, a fellow supervisor began acampaign of sexual harassmentwhich ended with her termination from UPS on July 10, 2007.Ms. Ramos, then 40 years old and earning about $75,000 annually, sued UPS for damages for sexual harassment and retaliation. At the conclusion of a seven week trial in March 2014, thejudge charged the juryand the Manhattan jurors then found in plaintiff’s favor on both of her claims and awardedemotional distress pain and suffering damages in the sum of $300,000(all past – six and a half years) as well asloss of earnings in the sum of $730,000($420,000 past, $310,000 future) andpunitive damages in the sum of $300,000.The trial judge issued apost-trial decisionordering areduction in the loss of earnings awards to $607,750(discussed below) to which plaintiff consented.InRivera v. United Parcel Service, Inc.(1st Dept. 2017), the appellate court affirmed the emotional distress and punitive damages awards as well as the reduced lost earnings awards.Plaintiff’s problems at UPS began after she became separated from her husband when her fellowsupervisor started making advances towards her. She testified that he told her he was available and she should be with him. He called her at all hours but she told him she was not interested in him. Then, she said,he tuned on her started making vulgar and obscene comments to her and was abusive towards her at work. The day after she formally complained, she was assigned to another location, an undesirable one entailing additional work. Then, rumors of her sexual promiscuity with other UPS drivers were spread throughout the workplace. Again she formally complained and again she was promptly transferred to other locations and then fired.UPS claimed  that the supervisor’s conduct was neither unwanted nor unwelcome and that this case was not about retaliation but instead about plaintiff’s “lies and deception.” Further, defendant claimed, plaintiff falsified records and improperly authorized a premises security breach (allowing a driver to avoid passing through the metal detector at day’s end) and these were the justifiable reasons she was fired.Defendant argued that $300,000 for emotional distress damages was excessivebecause, while plaintiff began counseling at the end of 2007 in connection with her failed marriage, it was not until September 2009 that she went for counseling which she attributed to her experiences at UPS (and the counseling was intermittent and lasted only a few months). Defendant urged that this aspect of the award should be reduced to no more than $50,000.There was no testimony from any health care professional or therapist; instead, plaintiff relied upon her own testimony and records which she argued supported the emotional distress award.Thejury’s past loss of earnings award was reduced by $112,250because (a)  the jury failed to take into account the amounts which plaintiff earned at several jobs after her termination and (b) plaintiff’s decision (after wrongful termination from one of those jobs) to forego comparable employment constituted a failure mitigate her damages. Thefuture loss of earnings award was reduced by $10,000;plaintiff’s attorney only asked for $300,000 based upon a claimed loss of $30,000 per year for 10 years.The jury determined that UPS, through its employees, acted with malice and reckless indifference to plaintiff’s rights and to the risk that its conduct might violate the law, its conduct was reprehensible and that plaintiff was thus entitled to an award ofpunitive damages. After the verdict was rendered, plaintiff elicited the testimony from a UPS finance director confirming public filings showing thatin 2013 UPS had net income of $4,372,000,000. The attorneys then madeclosing arguments as to the punitive damages claimand thejudge charged the jury as to the law on punitive damages. The appellate court affirmed the $300,000 punitive damages award after noting the defendant’s “substantial income” and comparing the award with those in similar cases.Inside Information:Prior to trial,plaintiff successfully moved to preclude evidence of a consensual sexual relationship she had engaged in with a co-employeeunrelated to her claims in the lawsuit. The judge ruled that private sexual relationships are essentially irrelevant in sexual harassment cases and that a plaintiff’s private sexual behavior does not change his or her expectations or entitlement to a workplace free of sexual harassment.",1230750,"Denise Rivera began working for United Parcel Service, Inc.

Again she formally complained and again she was promptly transferred to other locations and then fired.UPS claimed  that the supervisor’s conduct was neither unwanted nor unwelcome and that this case was not about retaliation but instead about plaintiff’s “lies and deception.” Further, defendant claimed, plaintiff falsified records and improperly authorized a premises security breach (allowing a driver to avoid passing through the metal detector at day’s end) and these were the justifiable reasons she was fired.Defendant argued that <redacted> for emotional distress damages was excessivebecause, while plaintiff began counseling at the end of 2007 in connection with her failed marriage, it was not until September 2009 that she went for counseling which she attributed to her experiences at UPS (and the counseling was intermittent and lasted only a few months). Defendant urged that this aspect of the award should be reduced to no more than <redacted>.There was no testimony from any health care professional or therapist; instead, plaintiff relied upon her own testimony and records which she argued supported the emotional distress award.Thejury’s past loss of earnings award was reduced by <redacted>because (a)  the jury failed to take into account the amounts which plaintiff earned at several jobs after her termination and (b) plaintiff’s decision (after wrongful termination from one of those jobs) to forego comparable employment constituted a failure mitigate her damages. Thefuture loss of earnings award was reduced by <redacted>;plaintiff’s attorney only asked for <redacted> based upon a claimed loss of <redacted> per year for 10 years.The jury determined that UPS, through its employees, acted with malice and reckless indifference to plaintiff’s rights and to the risk that its conduct might violate the law, its conduct was reprehensible and that plaintiff was thus entitled to an award ofpunitive damages. After the verdict was rendered, plaintiff elicited the testimony from a UPS finance director confirming public filings showing thatin 2013 UPS had net income of <redacted>. The attorneys then madeclosing arguments as to the punitive damages claimand thejudge charged the jury as to the law on punitive damages. The appellate court affirmed the <redacted> punitive damages award after noting the defendant’s “substantial income” and comparing the award with those in similar cases.Inside Information:Prior to trial,plaintiff successfully moved to preclude evidence of a consensual sexual relationship she had engaged in with a co-employeeunrelated to her claims in the lawsuit. The judge ruled that private sexual relationships are essentially irrelevant in sexual harassment cases and that a plaintiff’s private sexual behavior does not change his or her expectations or entitlement to a workplace free of sexual harassment.",185,4648

In the ensuing moments, the men, undercoverpolice officers with the New York City Police Department (the “NYPD”), scuffled with and arrested Gill. He was charged with possession of a weapon and resisting arrest.The officers claimed they saw Gill, then a 34 year old barber, reaching for a handgun but Gill claimed he did not have a gun and was simply reaching into his waistband to show the officers that the bulge they asked him about was simply a phone.During the arrest, Gill wasstruck in the face sustaining fracturesand a loss of consciousness.Gill was then taken in handcuffs to Kings County Hospital where he remained for three days, continuously cuffed to his bed, before he was taken to a holding cell for a few hours at Rikers Island and then released on bail.After hisacquittal on all charges, Gill sued the NYPD claiming damages for false arrest, malicious prosecution and battery.On June 6, 2014, following the trial judge’scharge to the juryas to the elements required to prove the claims, the Kings Countyjury ruled in favor of plaintiff finding that the police falsely arrested Gillbecause they did not have reasonable cause to make the arrest, theyused excessive forcein effecting the arrest and acted maliciously in initiating prosecution.The jury then awardeddamages in the sum of<redacted>:<redacted> for the false arrest,<redacted> for malicious prosecution, and<redacted> for battery –pain and suffering for the seven years from the date of the incident to the date of the verdictInGill v.

"For about eight months from 1964 to 1965, Harry Brown wasexposed to asbestoswhile he worked as an insulator atRavenswood 3, a newly constructed Con Edison powerhouse in Long Island City in Queens.Mr. Brown wasdiagnosed with mesothelioma in June of 2012 and died from the disease on September 8, 2013at the age of 75. He is survived by his wife Phyllis Brown and adult children.Before he died, Mr. Brown and his wife sued Con Edison and others alleging his exposure to asbestos-containing materials over the course of his 15 year career as an asbestos installer caused his mesothelioma. The suit was based onLabor Law 200and common law negligence principles that require employers to provide a safe place to work.After a four month trial, a Manhattan jury rendered averdicton March 18, 2014 finding that Con Edison had exercised supervision and control over workers at the powerhouse, failed to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises safe and that the failure was a substantial contributing factor in causing plaintiff’s mesothelioma. The jurors then awarded damages for (a)pain and suffering in the sum of $2,500,000(past only – 18 months) and (b) Mrs. Brown’sloss of services in the sum of $1,000,000(18 months).Defendant made apost-trial motionasking the trial judge to set aside the jury verdict claiming that there was insufficient proof that Con Edison exercised supervision and control over Mr. Brown’s work.  The motion was granted in anextensive decisionon August 29, 2014 that was adhered to seven months later in adecision following plaintiff’s motion to reargue.Con Edison did not challenge the pain and suffering award in its post-trial motion but did, alternatively argue that the loss of consortium award was excessive. Although she vacated the judgment and dismissed the complaint against Con Edison, thetrial judge also ordered that the loss of consortium award be reduced to$360,000.Plaintiff appealed arguing that (a) there was sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding of supervision and control under the statute and (b) the trial judge’s decision insofar as it addressed loss of consortium damages was advisory only in that having granted defendant’s motion to set aside the verdict, the issue of damages then became moot and, therefore, should the appellate court reinstate the liability verdict it should also reinstate the $1,000,000 loss of consortium award.InBrown v. Bell & Gossett Company(1st Dept. 2017),  the liabilityverdict against Con Edison has been reinstated and the award for loss of consortium damages has been reduced to $360,000.The defendant argued that the loss of consortium award was unwarranted based on the fact that at the time of Mr. Brown’s diagnosis and subsequent death, he had been retired from work, his children were grown and no longer living with him, he was also already suffering from stage four prostate cancer (unrelated to his asbestos exposure) and there no testimony from Mrs. Brown to evidence what support and services she lost, other than the loss of her husband’s love and companionship.Plaintiff argued, and the appellate judges apparently agreed (to an extent) that thedefendant and the trial judge overlooked testimony from Mrs. Brownthat proved she sustained significant loss of consortium damages. For example, she testified that her husband did repairs on their house including plumbing and building a garage, took care of all of the family finances including paying the bills, maintained the lawn and in general “took care of” both Mrs. Brown and their house. Furthermore, she testified that she assisted her husband daily with the medical consequences of his tragic disease such as draining his surgical incisions, attempting to control diarrhea, helping him move his body and dealing with the emotional problems affecting them both.Inside Information:AlthoughMr. Brown died two months before trial, he testified during pre-trial proceedings and the transcript of his deposition was read to the jurors.Since the jury found thatCon Edison did not act recklessly, its obligation to pay the damages awarded is limited to 65%:  its 30% proportionate share of liabilityplus,underCPLR 1602, the 35% share of plaintiff’s employer (defendant Robert A.

The jury awarded plaintiffpain and suffering damages in the sum of$25,000(past only – two and a half years).Thetrial judge denied plaintiff’s post-trial motionseeking a new trial on damages and inIovino v. Kaplan(2d Dept. 2016), the appellate court affirmed the judgment.As indicated in the decisions, plaintiff underwentarthroscopic surgery on her left shoulderbut there was a dispute as to whether plaintiff required the surgery because of atorn labrumor whether she merely had mildbursitis(and the surgery was not required).In addition, since this case implicated New York’s “No Fault Law” (Insurance Law Section 5102), in order to recover any damages at all for pain and suffering, plaintiff had to prove that her injuries met at least one of the so-called nine threshold categories. The jury found she had not sustained a permanent  consequential limitation or a significant limitation of use of her left shoulder injury, only that she was unable to perform her usual and customary activities for 90 out of the 180 days after the accident.Theimpact did not knock Ms. Iovino to the groundbut it did cause immediate excruciating pain in her arm and shoulder. Ms. Iovino declined an ambulance and her mother came from their home a few blocks away and they walked home together. The next day, she sought emergency room treatment at the local hospital where her shoulder was examined, she was given a prescription for pain medication and she was advised to follow up with a doctor should her pain persist.Plaintiff  treated with two orthopedic surgeons – first, about a week after the accident, with David R. Capiola, M.D. and thereafter with Dov Berkowitz, M.D. Dr. Capiola recommended physical therapy (which plaintiff underwent for a month) and an MRI (which was performed on October 20, 2011). Plaintiff switched to Dr. Berkowitz about five weeks after the accident; he too prescribed physical therapy but found significant range of motion deficits and recommended surgery which Ms. Iovino underwent on December 28, 2011.Much of the dispute as to whether the surgery was needed centered around the MRI which, both Dr. Berkowitz and defendant’s experts agreed, did not show a labral tear. Nonetheless,Dr. Berkowitz testifiedthat he recommended the surgery based upon plaintiff’s continuing pain, decreasing range of motion and positive results from both a Neer’s test and an O’Brien’s test. And, the doctor testified that during the surgery he actually saw the labral tear.Thedefense expert orthopedic surgeon, Edward Toriello, M.D., testifiedthat the surgery was not needed, there was no labral tear (at most, some minor fraying) and plaintiff sustained merely a shoulder strain and bursitis that had resolved.Ms. Iovino, a 35 year old executive assistant for a private equity firm, missed one week of work after the accident, then lost her job but returned to a similar job a month after her surgery and at trial was still working there. When asked about hercurrent condition, she testified that she takes over-the-counter medications to control daily shoulder pain but was able to work, was “not saying that I have a disability,” has “limitations as to what I can do” but can and does lift her three and seven year old children.Inside Information:In hisclosing argument, plaintiff’s attorney asked the jury to award $400,000 for past pain and suffering plus $800,000 for the future. Defense counsel suggested $15,000 for the past and nothing for the future.The defense argued that plaintiff should have called Dr. Capiola as a witness since he treated plaintiff (a) before and after a prior accident in 2008 in which she sustained a right shoulder injury requiring surgery and (b) after the current accident.

The parties agreed after the trial to reduce that  aspect of the verdict to $185,000 ($45,000 past, $140,000 future). Dr. Stein testified that the carpal tunnel surgery would cost about $50,000, physical therapy would add $10,000 more and that wrist fusion surgery would cost $80,000.

"On December 3, 2004 Alfonso Marin had just dropped off co-workers at their construction site when he was standing behind his parked van at 172nd Street and Broadway in upper Manhattan and anSUV smashed into him, pinning his left leg against the van and crushing his femur.Marin, then 40 years old, was rushed to the local hospital with a cold, pulseless leg and was diagnosed with severe trauma and massive degloving to his left lower extremity with multiple comminuted segmented fractures,  a complete transection of the bone andlacerated blood vessels, including the major artery and vein, causing extensive blood loss.In the operating room, doctors initially placed an external fixation device on the femur. Then, they performed a revascularization procedure (to try to restore blood flow to the lower leg) and a fasciotomy (to relieve swelling and help blood travel into the vessels toward the foot).  Finally, though, after several hours, Marin’sleg was surgically amputatedabove the knee.Marin sued the driver who hit him and recovered his full policy limits of $100,000. He thensued the hospital and the doctors (employed by the hospital) claiming that they prematurely abandoned their attempts to save his leg and should not have amputated it.A Manhattan jury concluded that the vascular surgeon had departed from accepted medical practice when he decided that no sufficient measures would control plaintiff’s bleeding in his leg and proceeded with the amputation. The orthopedic surgeon was exonerated.The jury then awarded plaintiffpain and suffering damages in the sum of$6,000,000($2,000,000 past – nine years, $4,000,000 future – 30 years).InMarin v. New York City Health & Hosps. Corp. (1st Dept. 2016), both the liability and damages verdicts have beenaffirmed.Defendants argued that due to the car crash plaintiff’s leg was already partially amputated when he arrived at the hospital and that heroic efforts to save the leg were made in the operating room but the leg was nonviable and could not be salvaged. That position was refuted by plaintiff’s experts who opined thatplaintiff would have had a substantial chance (30-40%) of saving the leg if aFogarty catheterhad been used to reestablish circulation.As to damages, defendants argued (unsuccessfully) that:the trial judge improperly denied theirrequest to have the jury apportion liability with the SUV driver(which, they contended, would have resulted in a complete or at least substantial reduction of the percentage of fault and thus the amount of damages they had to pay) andthe award was excessive becauseplaintiff would unquestionably have had significant permanent injuries regardless of any malpracticesince his leg was crushed and “functionally amputated” from the impact.Plaintiff conceded that his damages should be “less than an identically situated plaintiff whose entire injury was caused by the party-defendant” but argued, successfully, that the jury’s award was properbecause the judge correctly charged the jurors that plaintiff “should be compensated only to the extent that [the jurors] find his condition was made worse” and not “for damage done to the leg prior to his arrival [at] the hospital.”Here are theinjury details:above-the-knee amputation of left legplacement of five prosthetic legs to date (with several more needed in the future)shrinking stump and ulcersconstant “phantom” pain (despite prescription pain medications)worsening prognosis as to ability to ambulate leading to wheelchair confinement in the futureInside Information:Plaintiff could not return to any type of construction work but was able to earn money by selling ices from a cart in the summer and churros in the winter.The jury heard from life care plan experts for both sides and awardedeconomic damages in the sum of $1,652,755for future medical and psychological care, medications, equipment and supplies, and physical therapy.The vascular surgeon who was found liable testified that he had used the Fogarty catheter; however, there was no mention of the catheter in the medical records.

"Just two months ago,here, we reviewed recent appellate court decisions dealing withpain and suffering damages in mesothelioma cases. The sameappellate court has issued  decisions inthree more casesinvolving similar issues and damages. In all of the cases, hard-working men suffered horribly difficult final years before succumbing to a premature death due to the ravages of mesothelioma. In each case, the jury’s award for pain and suffering was drastically slashed by the courts.Selwyn Hackshawwas a retiree in his early 70’s in late 2012 when he learned he was suffering from mesothelioma. For many years he’d been an electrician and a pipe fitter, working at plants installing and repairing gaskets and valves  manufactured by Crane Company containing asbestos.Hackshaw sued Crane claiming that his mesothelioma was caused by his inhalation of asbestos in gaskets, insulation and valves that he’d handled over the years. During the tendency of his lawsuit but before trial, Mr. Hackshaw died from the disease on August 3, 2013.On June 16, 2014 a Manhattan jury returned a verdict finding that Crane had failed to provide adequate warnings about the hazards of exposure to asbestos regarding its products and that its negligence caused Mr. Hackshaw’s mesothelioma. The jury then awarded pain and suffering damages in the sum of $10,000,000 (past – 12 months).On January 7, 2015 the trial judge reduced the damages to $6,000,000 and inHackshaw v. ABB, Inc.(1st Dept. 2016),the appellate court further reduced the damages to$3,000,000.Ivan Swebergwas also a retiree when he learned in mid-2012, at the age of 70, that he too was suffering from mesothelioma. Mr. Sweberg had been an electrician involved in the construction of buildings from 1956-1972 when he worked with others who were installing and removing asbestos manufactured by Crane.In Mr. Sweberg’s lawsuit against Crane (consolidated for trial with Mr. Hackshaw’s lawsuit), the jury found Crane liable and awarded pain and suffering damages in the sum of $15,000,000 ($5,000,000 past – two years, $10,000,000 future – 1.5 years).The trial judge reduced the damages to $10,000,000 ($5,000,000 past, $5,000,000 future) and inSweberg v. ABB, Inc.(1st Dept. 2016),the appellate court further reduced the damages to$9,500,000($5,000,000 past, $4,500,000 future).Ivo Peraicawas 63 years old in August 2011 when he learned that he was suffering from mesothelioma. For many years, Mr. Sweberg serviced boilers manufactured by Crane that contained asbestos and his inhalation of fibers of asbestos caused mesothelioma.Mr. Peraica sued Crane but died from mesothelioma before trial, on December 28, 2012, at the age of 64. On March 1, 2013, a Manhattan jury found Crane liable and awarded pain and suffering damages in the sum of$35,000,000(past – 17 months).The trial judge reduced the damages to $18,000,000 and inPeraica v. A.O. Smith Water Products Co.(1st Dept. 2016),the appellate court further reduced the damages to$4,250,000.Inside Information:In each of the three cases, there were several defendants other than Crane and the jurors were instructed to apportion liability among them all (some defendants no longer existed, others had settled, etc.). Here are theverdict sheetsin theHackshawandSwebergcases.The post-trial decision inHackshaw and Sweberg is hereand inPeraica, here.The juries determined that Crane acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others, thereby negating the liability limitations ofCPLR Section 1601and restoring Crane’s joint and several liability. Pursuant toGeneral Obligations Law (“GOL”) Section 15-108, though, plaintiffs’ verdicts in these cases, as reduced by the post-trial decisions (but before the additional appellate court reductions), were further reduced, in each case, by the greater of the aggregate pre-verdict settlements with other defendants or their aggregate percentages of fault.  InHackshaw, therefore, plaintiff’s judgment (before interest) was $2,909,646 and inSwebergit was for $4,997,200.The appellate court decision inPeraicais erroneous as to damages in that it refers to the jury award as $9,900,800 when in fact it was $35,000,000 (thereafter reduced by the trial judge, as mentioned above, to $18,000,000). Thejudgmentagainst Crane amounted to $9,900,800 (before interest) but that was based first upon the $18,000,000 award from the trial judge and then the reduction of that sum pursuant to the GOL.Along with plaintiff’s notice to the appellate court regarding its significant calculation error inPeraica, we expect that plaintiff inSwebergwill accept the relatively small reduction and propose an amended judgment. In bothHackshawandPeraica, though, we expect plaintiffs will mount a constitutional challenge to the continuing practice of New York’s intermediate appellate courts of reducing jury awards for pain and suffering in mesothelioma cases by millions of dollars, even tens of millions.Ivan Sweberg died from his mesothelioma in July 2014.",4250000,"Just two months ago,here, we reviewed recent appellate court decisions dealing withpain and suffering damages in mesothelioma cases.

On March 1, 2013, a Manhattan jury found Crane liable and awarded pain and suffering damages in the sum of<redacted>(past – 17 months).The trial judge reduced the damages to <redacted> and inPeraica v. A.O. Smith Water Products Co.(1st Dept. 2016),the appellate court further reduced the damages to<redacted>.Inside Information:In each of the three cases, there were several defendants other than Crane and the jurors were instructed to apportion liability among them all (some defendants no longer existed, others had settled, etc.). Here are theverdict sheetsin theHackshawandSwebergcases.The post-trial decision inHackshaw and Sweberg is hereand inPeraica, here.The juries determined that Crane acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others, thereby negating the liability limitations ofCPLR Section 1601and restoring Crane’s joint and several liability. Pursuant toGeneral Obligations Law (“GOL”) Section 15-108, though, plaintiffs’ verdicts in these cases, as reduced by the post-trial decisions (but before the additional appellate court reductions), were further reduced, in each case, by the greater of the aggregate pre-verdict settlements with other defendants or their aggregate percentages of fault.  InHackshaw, therefore, plaintiff’s judgment (before interest) was <redacted> and inSwebergit was for <redacted>.The appellate court decision inPeraicais erroneous as to damages in that it refers to the jury award as <redacted> when in fact it was <redacted> (thereafter reduced by the trial judge, as mentioned above, to <redacted>). Thejudgmentagainst Crane amounted to <redacted> (before interest) but that was based first upon the <redacted> award from the trial judge and then the reduction of that sum pursuant to the GOL.Along with plaintiff’s notice to the appellate court regarding its significant calculation error inPeraica, we expect that plaintiff inSwebergwill accept the relatively small reduction and propose an amended judgment. In bothHackshawandPeraica, though, we expect plaintiffs will mount a constitutional challenge to the continuing practice of New York’s intermediate appellate courts of reducing jury awards for pain and suffering in mesothelioma cases by millions of dollars, even tens of millions.Ivan Sweberg died from his mesothelioma in July 2014.",207,4979

New York City Transit Authority(1st Dept. 2016), both the liability and damages awards were affirmed.Here are theinjury and damages details:Pain and Suffering:  Plaintiff’s expert forensic pathologist opined that Ms. Levy died due to multiple blunt force crush injuries of her head, chest, pelvis and upper extremities and that she sufferedtwo to five seconds of conscious pain and sufferingfrom the time she was struck by the bus to the time she lost consciousness and succumbed to her injuries. He broke the time period down to the pre-impact phase (the few seconds before impact when Ms. Levy recognized she would be hit, the impact phase (when the bus hit her, propelled her, knocked her down and began to run over her) and the post-impact phase (once the bus finished rolling over Ms. Levy when her entire body experienced total shock before no longer responding to her environment). The defendants’ expert opined that Ms. Levy died instantly, without pain or suffering and that it was impossible to say if or how long Ms. Levy was conscious at the time of or after impact.Loss of Nurture, Care and Guidance: Ms. Oates, 40 years old at trial, left her mother’s home after college when she married and moved to North Carolina. Se continued to rely upon her mother for nurture, care, guidance and advice (especially regarding her own young daughter) via frequent phone calls and visits to New York several times a year.Loss of Custodial Services: Hadassah Levy, 77 years old at trial, lived with her daughter (the decedent), was disabled, suffered from several health conditions (e.g., severe rheumatoid arthritis, back issues, eye disease and sleep apnea) and she required daily household and medical assistance. The decedent provided her mother with daily custodial services including grocery shopping, cleaning, laundry, cooking, driving and keeping track of medications.Inside Information:Thefive judge appellate panel split 3-2in favor of affirming the verdict and the defendants have exercised their right (by virtue of the split decision) to seek review from the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals.

Additionally, the appellate court rejected claimants’ contention that the trial judge erred in using a personal consumption rate of 45% (their expert used a rate of 28.5% while defendant’s used a rate of 95%).The affirmed parental loss of guidance awards in the sums of$350,000($300,000 past – 9 years, $50,000 future – 3 years) for Brandon (28 years old at trial) and$475,000($425,000 past – 9 years, $50,000 future – three years) for Ryan (24 years old at trial)  were based upon the testimony of the sons about how involved and supportive their father was in their lives as well as testimony from their mother (to whom Gardner was married for 14 years before they divorced four years before his death) and several of Col.

The appellate court noted that the children were teenagers but that  courts may even award damages to financially dependent adults.The trial judge declined to make any award at all for pre-death physical pain and suffering because, even though Col. Gardner may have lived for a short time after impact (as much as a minute or two), “there is no evidence he was conscious upon impact or had some level of awareness of his pain.” This ruling was not appealed.The defendant appealed trial judge’s periodic method of payment (but not the amount) of the $1,365,000 award for loss of inheritance but the appellate court ruled thatCPLR 5041, the statute requiring a lump sum present value for certain awards, is not applicable in this case.",3569985,"On January 24, 2004, Col.

Gardner’s friends. The trial judge specifically noted that the evidence was clear that there was a strong bond between father and sons, Col. Gardner was a role model for them and his advice and guidance would have continued as his sons graduated college and began their careers. The appellate court noted that the children were teenagers but that  courts may even award damages to financially dependent adults.The trial judge declined to make any award at all for pre-death physical pain and suffering because, even though Col. Gardner may have lived for a short time after impact (as much as a minute or two), “there is no evidence he was conscious upon impact or had some level of awareness of his pain.” This ruling was not appealed.The defendant appealed trial judge’s periodic method of payment (but not the amount) of the <redacted> award for loss of inheritance but the appellate court ruled thatCPLR 5041, the statute requiring a lump sum present value for certain awards, is not applicable in this case.",213,2863

At the time of trial, he was enrolled in the ninth grade for his third consecutive year.Plaintiff took his shoes off and showed the jurors his feet, particularly his deformed left foot. According to defense counsel, this was “avery emotional moment” and jurors were seen crying.Angel’s step-father is a Marine Corps platoon sergeantwho served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He attended each day of trial in full military uniform (a fact the defense argued in summation was calculated to arouse the jury’s passion).Angel wasable to work part-time as a cashierfor Marine Corps Community Services,  a fact the defense claimed demonstrated the excessiveness of the jury’s future pain and suffering award. He had very much wanted to follow the footsteps of his step-father (“his hero”) and become a Marine.Semper Fi.",219,3830

A Kings County jury agreed with the plaintiff to an extent – it determined that thecity was 60% at fault for the accident(and that plaintiff bore 40% of the fault).On December 14, 2012, the jurors awarded plaintiffpain and suffering damages in the sum of$200,000($150,000 past – 4 1/2 years, $50,000 future – 20 years).On May 20, 2013,the trial judge issued a decision denying plaintiff”s post-trial motionin which plaintiff argued that the $50,000 award for future pain and suffering damages was inadequate and inKnoch v.

Ms. Knoch, a 36 year IRS employee (a facilities manager, in charge of three buildings) who was on the job at the time of her fall, returned to work a month or so after the accident while continuing physical therapy until December 2007 (when she started with home exercises).Thedefense argued that the jury award for future damages was adequatebecause plaintiff failed to mitigate her own damages in that (a) she discontinued physical therapy on her own (in part because she did not want to get home late from work and did not want to go during the work day – “there was no time to schedule in physical therapy”) and (b) she failed to undergo the surgery her doctor recommended.The surgery – an arthroscopic procedure known aslysis of adhesions with manipulation under anesthesia– would have involved cuttting the scar tissue and adhesions to allow more shoulder movement.Plaintiff argued that the mitigation charge was unwarranted. As to physical therapy, she pointed out that she continued with home exercises and as to surgery, she testified she was anxious to get approval from her workers compensation carrier but she was turned down and could not afford it.The jury also awarded plaintiff future medical expenses in the sum of $31,000.$18,000 – for the cost of surgery, plus$10,000 – for one year of post-surgery physical therapy, plus$3,000 – for prescription medications.Plaintiff argued on appeal that the jury’s award of these future medical expenses made it clear that it was inconsistent and inadequate to award only $50,000 for 20 years of future pain and suffering.Defendant, though, argued that:it was not at all clear that the workers compensation carrier denied  requests to approve the surgery (proof was essentially the oral testimony of plaintiff and some notes from a treating doctor who was not called to testify),there was insufficient proof that plaintiff could not afford to pay for the surgery herself, and,the jury must have correctly concluded that plaintiff had already improved somewhat by the time of trial and that surgery would also improve her condition.Inside Information:The defendant repeatedly failed to produce evidence during the pre-trial discovery phase of this lawsuit that it was ordered to produce and the trial judge issued a $2,500monetary sanction that was upheld on appeal.Plaintiff admitted on cross-examination that one of thereasons she stopped physical therapywas that if she went during work hours the time she used would not count towards her pension. She knew then that she’d be retiring soon and in fact did so in 2011 shortly before trial.Thedefense orthopedic surgery expert, Alan J.

The trial judge denied both applications.InRoy L. N., Jr. v. New York City Housing Authority(1st Dept. 2015), the appellate court upheld the jury verdict finding that $250,000 for past pain and suffering is not excessive. The issue of future damages was not addressed by the court because plaintiff did not appeal from the trial judge’s refusal to add such an award.As set forth in the court’s decision, Roy sustained aspiral fracture of his left tibiaalong with soft tissue damage to the surrounding area. He was hospitalized for three days, underwent debridement of dead tissue and wore a hard cast for 6 1/2 weeks. He recovered with an unsightlykeloid scarand his ability to engage in sports was significantly impeded because of the muscle and tendon damage.Here arefurther injury details:The fracture was proximal/mid tibia, open and extended through the cortex.Initial hospital treatment included amassiveirrigation and debridementto dilute the wound and remove dead tissue.After his hospital discharge, Roy had to use crutches to ambulate and stayed home in the summer with his leg elevated.Upon return to school in September, Roy was still casted and could not participate in any physical activities until January.The keloid scar was 2 1/2 inches long and one inch wide; it is permanent and “cannot be improved.”Roystill had leg pain at the time of trialbut had returned to sports such as basketball within three months of the incident.Inside Information:Insummations, plaintiff’s counsel asked the jury to award $300,000 for past pain and suffering plus $400,000 for the future. Defense counsel contended that plaintiff had fully healed and should be awarded no more than $50,000.Each side produced an orthopedic surgeon.

He recovered with an unsightlykeloid scarand his ability to engage in sports was significantly impeded because of the muscle and tendon damage.Here arefurther injury details:The fracture was proximal/mid tibia, open and extended through the cortex.Initial hospital treatment included amassiveirrigation and debridementto dilute the wound and remove dead tissue.After his hospital discharge, Roy had to use crutches to ambulate and stayed home in the summer with his leg elevated.Upon return to school in September, Roy was still casted and could not participate in any physical activities until January.The keloid scar was 2 1/2 inches long and one inch wide; it is permanent and “cannot be improved.”Roystill had leg pain at the time of trialbut had returned to sports such as basketball within three months of the incident.Inside Information:Insummations, plaintiff’s counsel asked the jury to award <redacted> for past pain and suffering plus <redacted> for the future. Defense counsel contended that plaintiff had fully healed and should be awarded no more than <redacted>.Each side produced an orthopedic surgeon. Plaintiff’s expert,Leonard Harrison, M.D. testifiedthat Roy had a mild residual condition that left him walking with his left foot tuned out and that he would always have pain when running, jumping and in cold weather. Defendant’s expert,Herbert Sherry, M.D., opinedthat plaintiff made an excellent recovery, needs no further treatment and has no limitations.Plaintiff admitted that he’d been playing sports ever since a few months after his accidentand that he can “slash down the lane” in basketball and run fast as a wide receiver in football, “but not as fast” as he used to.",230,3266
"On August 16, 2006, Nancy Cruztripped and fell due to a defect in a rubber playground matat a picnic in the Bronx. Ms. Cruz, then 49 years old, was attending a cookout with her five-year-old grandson when her foot became caught in a worn-out hole in the mat causing her to fall forward and strike her right (dominant) elbow on the ground.In her ensuing lawsuit, the jury found that theplayground owner and picnic sponsor – Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center – was negligent in failing to maintain the area in a reasonably safe conditionand that its negligence caused Ms. Cruz’s injuries. Plaintiff was found to be free of any comparative negligence.On September 7, 2012, the Bronx Countyjurors awarded plaintiff pain and suffering damages in the sum of$570,000($300,000 past – six years, $270,000 future –  27 years).Following apost-trial motionby the defendant, the jury’s findings as to liability were upheld but thetrial judge issued adecisionon May 10, 2013 in which he agreed with the defense that the damages awards were excessive and he ordered areduction to $200,000($140,000 past, $60,000 future).InCruz v. Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center(1st Dept. 2015), the liability verdict was affirmed and thejury’s $570,000 pain and suffering award was reinstated.As set forth in the appellate court decision, plaintiff was taken via ambulance to a hospital where she wasdiagnosed with an avuslion or “chip fracture” and a dislocation of her right elbow.

After the verdict (but before he reduced the award), the trial judge indicated that awarding future damages for a 27 year period troubled him but so did the fact that the defense made no settlement offer.

His wife Venetia Chiara was a front seat passenger and their triplet eight year boys were all rear seat passengers. Mrs. Chiara and one of her sons, Nicholas, were injured.Scene of the AccidentDernago was employed by Connecticut Shellfish Company and had been making deliveries to restaurants that day.  Towards the end of his route,Dernago stopped at Hooters in Paramus where he drank about 10 beers. He then headed to his last stop in City Island but before he got there he caused the crash with the Chiara family.Chiara was arrested at the scene andcharged with driving while intoxicated. He pled guilty a month later andwent to jail for four months.The Bar at Hooters in Paramus, NJIn the ensuing lawsuit,defense lawyers conceded that Dernago was intoxicated but suggested that the pick-up truck struck plaintiffs vehicle before any impact from the defendant. Dernago did not testify in court but in his deposition transcript he said he heard only one impact and the jurors made short shrift of the defense argument and returned a verdict of full liability against the defendant.In the damages portion of the bifurcated trial the defendants argued that Mrs. Chiara’s claimed neck injury did not meet the serious injury threshold underInsurance Law Section 5102(d); however, on September 21, 2011, the Nassau County jurors disagreed and returned averdict for pain and suffering in the sum of$160,000($90,000 past – six years, $70,000 future – 28 years).

She admitted, though, that “there’s nothing I cannot do at all.”Plaintiff’s injuries and treatment were testified to by her neurologist James Liguori M.D.; whereas defendants offered the testimony of expert radiologist A. Robert Tantleff, M.D. who reviewed plaintiff’s MRI and said that there was no nerve root compression,  plaintiff’s condition was completely related to degenerative disc disease and she had not sustained an acute herniation.The award ofpunitive damageswas based upon plaintiff’s claim that not only was Dernago a drunk driver with ablood alcohol test more than two times the legal limitbut also that his conduct was so outrageous that it amounted to wanton and reckless behavior that should be punished. The defense argued that drunk driving alone will not as a matter of law support a punitive damage claim (that is correct) and that there was little or no evidence to meet the higher burden needed for punitive damages, especially in view of the fact that Mr. Dernago was pulled over by a police officer for failure to signal a lane change about 10-15 minutes before the crash,  was given a field sobriety test and let go without any tickets.Inside Information:The claim by plaintiff’s sonNicholaswas settled during trial for the sum of $25,000.

After his vehicle stopped because of a deer carcass in the roadway,another car smashed into the rear of the minivanpropelling it 35 feet forward.Saw Mill River Parkway northbound at Readers Digest Road (exit 33) in Chappaqua.Mr. Taurone, then 51 years old, had sustainedprior traumatic incidentsin which he’d injured his neck and, as a result,just 28 days before this accident he underwent major surgery– an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C5-6 and C6-7 with cortical bone implants and the insertion of a titanium plate and seven screws.In Mr. Taurone’s ensuing lawsuit against the owner and operator of the other vehicle,defendants conceded liability and the trial was limited to the amount of damages only.Plaintiff contendedthat the car crash causedsignificant new and aggravated injuriesto his spine.Defendants arguedthat (a) plaintiff’s new or aggravated injuries werenot seriousenough to meet the threshold underInsurance Law Section 5102and (b) that the new/aggravated injuries were solely the result of plaintiff’s prior accidents or a fall out of bed that occurred eight days after the crash.On May 31, 2013, the Westchester county jury found for the plaintiff and awarded himpain and suffering damages in the sum of$1,000,000($400,000 past –  3 1/2 years, $600,000 future – 15 years). Defendants appealed urging that the statutory threshold had not been met and therefore the judgment should be vacated. InGiardina v. Barasch(2d Dept. 2015), the appellate court rejected the defendants’ contentions and affirmed the judgment.The court’s decision focused on the issue of defendants’ in-trial application for an adjournment so that a second physician could be brought in to rebut the testimony of plaintiff’s physicians. The trial judge initially granted the request but when the defense expert became unavailable the judge denied a second adjournment request. This, the appellate court ruled, was well within the trial judge’s discretion and not a reason to overturn the judgment.The damages issues are nowhere addressed in the appellate court decision except to the extent of a statement that deemed defendants’ remaining contention “without merit.”Following the accident, Mr. Taurone wasadmitted to the hospital for six dayswhere he was immediately seen by the neurosurgeon, Thomas Lee, M.D., who had operated on him 28 days before.Dr. Lee testifiedthat the car accident caused further injury to Mr. Taurone’s C-6 vertebrae and that as a result theplate and screw system he had installed weeks before had “pulled out on the bottom”and dislodged thus requiringnew surgeryon January 6, 2010:  removal of the prior instrumentation and a revision anterior cervical interbody fusion at C5-6 and C6-7.Unfortunately, plaintiff’s spine deteriorated further – a result not unusual with the type of revision surgery he underwent – and athird surgerywas required on August 21, 2012 – acomplex posterior laminectomy at C4-5 and C5-6.This was done byReza Yassari, M.D., who testifiedthat plaintiff had severe myelopathy and that his radiating pain was so bad that he couldn’t use one hand. The surgery he performed would not, he testified, stop the progressive deterioration of plaintiff’s spine but would slow it down.The defense case rested upon thetestimony of radiologist David Fisher, M.D.who opined that there was neither a new nor an exacerbated injury to plaintiff’s spine as a result of the November 9, 2009 accident and in particular that the accident did not dislodge the previously implanted plate and screws.

"We discussed the nearly $15,000,000 damages award in the fatal motor vehicle crash case of 28 year old Jason M. Rhoades in anarticle published on December 3, 2013, here.As we predicted, the defendant appealed arguing that the loss of parental guidance awards were excessive and that the loss of inheritance awards were improper.Last week, the appellate court ruled inGrevelding v. State of New York(4th Dept. 2015) andheld that the loss of parental guidance awards were excessive but that the loss of inheritance awards were reasonable and proper.In addition, the court rejected the defendant’s argument that the entire damages award should have been reduced by an apportionment of some liability on the basis of decedent driver’s comparative fault.Theloss of parental guidance awards for the decedent’ssonLuke(two years old at the time of his father’s death, 11 at trial) in the sum of $2,000,000 ($900,000 past – 9 years, $1,100,000 future – 7 years) werereduced by $600,000andnow stand at $1,400,000($500,000 past , $900,000 future).Theloss of parental guidance awards for the decedent’sdaughterAmelia(two months old at the time of her father’s death, 9 at trial) in the sum of $2,200,000 ($900,000 past – 9 years, $1,300,000 future – 9 years) werereduced by $700,000andnow stand at $1,500,000($500,000 past, $1,000,000 future).While the loss of parental guidance award reductions are significant, the modified awards remain among the highest allowed by the appellate courts in New York. The judges were apparently influenced by substantialtestimony that Mr. Rhoades was by all accounts an exemplary father who came home every day at 5:30 p.m. and took over responsibility for his two young children and that he and his son were “inseparable.”The $1,603,306 awards of damages forloss of inheritancewere based upon expert testimony projecting (1) a savings rate of 2% of Rhoades’ income and (2) an investment growth rate of 8.2%.The defense argued on appeal that the loss of inheritance awards should be vacated because they were duplicative of the $8,728,980 awarded to decedent’s spouse and children for their loss of his past and future income, support and household services. The court rejected that argument since it has long been held and is routinely explained to juries by trial judges that the monetary damages to a decedent’s distributees (here, his wife and two children) includeboththe portion of decedent’s earnings he would have spent in the future for their care and support and the amount if any that would have been inherited by them.Inside Information:Neither party appealed with regard to the issues of the amounts of damages awarded forpre-impact terror($250,000) orloss of income, support and household services($8,728,980).Mr.Rhoades suffered the tragic death of both of his parents when he was 17 years old. Thereafter, he lived by himself in an apartment while he finished high school. Then, he completed a bachelor’s degree at Syracuse University in less than three years and an MBA at LeMoyne College in just one year, all while holding down jobs in the telecommunications industry.The issue of damages in the wrongful death case ofGardner v. State of New York, involving another fatal motor vehicle crash at the same site just 36 hours after this accident  (about which we also wrote in our December 3, 2013 article), is the subject of an appeal set for oral argument in the 4th Department on December 7, 2015.",1400000,"We discussed the nearly <redacted> damages award in the fatal motor vehicle crash case of 28 year old Jason M.

State of New York(4th Dept. 2015) andheld that the loss of parental guidance awards were excessive but that the loss of inheritance awards were reasonable and proper.In addition, the court rejected the defendant’s argument that the entire damages award should have been reduced by an apportionment of some liability on the basis of decedent driver’s comparative fault.Theloss of parental guidance awards for the decedent’ssonLuke(two years old at the time of his father’s death, 11 at trial) in the sum of <redacted> (<redacted> past – 9 years, <redacted> future – 7 years) werereduced by <redacted>andnow stand at <redacted>(<redacted> past , <redacted> future).Theloss of parental guidance awards for the decedent’sdaughterAmelia(two months old at the time of her father’s death, 9 at trial) in the sum of <redacted> (<redacted> past – 9 years, <redacted> future – 9 years) werereduced by <redacted>andnow stand at <redacted>(<redacted> past, <redacted> future).While the loss of parental guidance award reductions are significant, the modified awards remain among the highest allowed by the appellate courts in New York. The judges were apparently influenced by substantialtestimony that Mr. Rhoades was by all accounts an exemplary father who came home every day at 5:30 p.m. and took over responsibility for his two young children and that he and his son were “inseparable.”The <redacted> awards of damages forloss of inheritancewere based upon expert testimony projecting (1) a savings rate of 2% of Rhoades’ income and (2) an investment growth rate of 8.2%.The defense argued on appeal that the loss of inheritance awards should be vacated because they were duplicative of the <redacted> awarded to decedent’s spouse and children for their loss of his past and future income, support and household services. The court rejected that argument since it has long been held and is routinely explained to juries by trial judges that the monetary damages to a decedent’s distributees (here, his wife and two children) includeboththe portion of decedent’s earnings he would have spent in the future for their care and support and the amount if any that would have been inherited by them.Inside Information:Neither party appealed with regard to the issues of the amounts of damages awarded forpre-impact terror(<redacted>) orloss of income, support and household services(<redacted>).Mr.Rhoades suffered the tragic death of both of his parents when he was 17 years old. Thereafter, he lived by himself in an apartment while he finished high school. Then, he completed a bachelor’s degree at Syracuse University in less than three years and an MBA at LeMoyne College in just one year, all while holding down jobs in the telecommunications industry.The issue of damages in the wrongful death case ofGardner v. State of New York, involving another fatal motor vehicle crash at the same site just 36 hours after this accident  (about which we also wrote in our December 3, 2013 article), is the subject of an appeal set for oral argument in the 4th Department on December 7, 2015.",245,3439

He was ultimately diagnosed with an early stage ofavascular necrosiswhen MRI film three months later showed a loss of blood supply to the hip.According to his doctor, plaintiff’s condition results in portions of dead bone in the hip for which there are two types of surgery – one involves drilling a hole in the bone and irrigating it with blood (which the doctor testified is only 40% successful), the other is atotal hip replacement (which the doctor recommendedbut plaintiff hadn’t yet undergone).Here are theinjury details:used either a cane or crutches for seven weeks; at trial he walked with alimppersistent andpermanent hip painsignificant loss of range of motionunable to return at all to activities he’d enjoyed daily for 30 years such as martial arts, cycling and runningunable to play with his teenage childrenunable stand for more than 45 minutes or sit for long periodsforced to sleep on first floor couch four nights a week due to inability to climb stairs to second floor bedroompost-traumatic hip arthritisInside Information:Plaintiff testified that despite being in severe painat the scene of the crash, he declined medical treatmentbecause he was driving home from his jewelry store and had in his possession valuable diamonds and was concerned for their security.There was no loss of earnings claim.Plaintifftreated with his orthopedic surgeon only five times(four in 2009 and once in May 2011 shortly before trial).Plaintiff’spre-trial settlement demand was <redacted>with no offer from the defendant.",251,3603

Miguel “got nervous,” accelerated, mounted the sidewalk to “get away from the guy grabbing” him and then hit a parked car.It turns out thatthe stopped car was an unmarked police vehicle with anti-crime officers inside. One of the officers testified that he opened his door only when he saw Bonano on the sidewalk a couple of car lengths behind the police car, intending to tell him to get off the sidewalk.Bonano sued the city claiming that the officer who opened the door into his path was negligent and caused him to lose control of his dirt bikeresulting in the crash and his injuries.On June 6, 2012,at the end of the trial, the judge instructed the jury as to the applicable law,including Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 1214 regarding opening and closing of car doors.The jury substantially agreed with plaintiff’s version of the facts when it returned averdict finding the city 85% at fault(and plaintiff 15% comparatively negligent).As to damages, thejury awarded plaintiff$1,640,000for his pain and suffering($500,000 past – 10 years, $1,140,000 future – 20 years).

Nonetheless, plaintiff’s counsel concluded that if the appellate court were to make a reduction it should be to an amount not less than <redacted>.Inside Information:The jury also awarded plaintiff<redacted> for her medical expenses(<redacted> past, <redacted> future), an amount which was not challenged on appeal.Plaintiff was able to operate her daycare business by hiring additional people but she madeno claim for lost earnings.Plaintiff was agraduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with degrees in mechanical and aerospace engineeringand worked in those fields for about three years before attending City College to obtain a master’s in education and starting her childcare business shortly before her accident.In its post-trial motion seeking to set aside the entire verdict, thedefendant claimed that plaintiff improperly concealed until she was cross-examined at trial the fact that she had a lifelong medical condition that causes dizziness, blurred vision and hallucinations. The judge issued adecisionfinding no merit to that argument.",256,4043

He issued adecisionfinding that there was no valid line of reasoning that could lead to the conclusion that the city had constructive notice of the ice patch that caused plaintiff to fall.

"A 31 year old administrative assistant had been feeling right flank pain for several weeks when she was referred to a surgeon who diagnosed her with symptomaticcholelithiasis (gallstones). Accordingly, on March 30, 2009, she  underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy(gallbladder removal surgery)at  Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was discharged to home that night.Unfortunately, the woman returned to the hospital 10 days later complaining of severe pain radiating to her back as well as a fever, nausea, vomiting and chills. She was diagnosed with aperforated iliac arterythat caused a pseudoaneurysm (a hematoma that occurs outside of an artery or vein) and a retroperitoneal hematoma. She was in a life-threatening situation and had to undergoemergency surgery to insert a stent into the artery. The surgery was successful and she was discharged from the hospital after three days.A lawsuit was brought against the surgeon who performed the gallbladder surgery claiming that he deviated from acceptable medical practice when the needle he was using to probe into the gallbladder punctured the iliac artery. It took the Bronx County jurors only 40 minutes to return their verdict on February 13, 2013 finding malpractice had occurred and awardingpast pain and suffering damages (four years) in the sum of$800,000.The jurors were not presented the issue offuture pain and suffering damagesbecause the trial judge had ruled that there was insufficient medical evidence from plaintiff’s expert as to how any of her current complaints of pain were associated with either of her surgeries.The defense argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the malpractice finding and Justice Norma Ruiz agreed and issued apost-trial decision dismissing the case.On appeal, though, inPadilla v.

The defense claimed that she failed to prove her injury was not from the prior accident. Plaintiff, however, argued that she had completely recovered from the 10 year old accident, had returned to work and had no problems with her left knee within the year leading up to this accident. Furthermore, Dr. Bansal testified that despite the prior surgery she had a substantial amount of her meniscus remaining. The defendant’s expert orthopedic surgeon, Maurice Carter, M.D., testified that plaintiff’s current accident did not result in a traumatic tear to her meniscus or chondromalacia and he opined that her condition was “clearly a degenerative tear, wear and tear.”Inside Information:Inclosing arguments, plaintiff’s counsel asked the jury to award pain and suffering damages in the sum of $750,000 whereas defense counsel argued plaintiff was not believable and was entitled to nothing at all.After a two and one-half week trial, thejury was sent out to deliberate at 4:30 p.m. and at 5:05 p.m. they advised the judge that they had reached a verdict. Defense counsel argued on appeal, unsuccessfully, that a new trial should have been ordered because the jury rushed to judgment.In 2005, Ms.Singleton filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcypetition but failed to list her then pending personal injury lawsuit in the schedule of her assets.

New York City Transit Authority(1st Dept. 2014), the appellate court affirmed the jury’s liability finding  butreduced the award for future pain and suffering damages by $500,000(from $1,300,000 to $800,000).After the reduction, thetotal pain and suffering award now stands at $1,400,000.Theappellate court also affirmed the jury’s other awards in the sums of$650,000for lost earnings and$60,000for medical expenses.

"Joshua Delgado was born on November 27, 2006 at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx.

After a two week trial, the jury agreed and on October 14, 2011 returned a verdict of malpractice and awardedpain and suffering damages in the sum of$620,000($20,000 past – 5 years, $600,000 future – 20 years).The defendant appealed, successfully arguing that the amount of damages was excessive. InDelgado v. Murray(1st Dept. 2014), theappellate court ordered a reduction of the future damages award from $600,000 to $300,000.Plaintiff contended that Joshua sustained permanent nerve damageto the nerves in the brachial plexus area innervating the left arm, wrist and hand causing the following injuries and deficits:impairment of shoulder rotationscapular wingingimpairment of ability to have the left hand reach the back of the headimpaired ability to rotate the left handdecreased length of the left arm which will eventually result in a 10% difference in arm lengthslikely development of contractures in the future which “may require surgical correction”Thedefense countered, successfully arguing that this was a “mild” Erb’s palsy case, a term the appellate court adopted in its decision and that:physical therapy (discontinued by June 2009) gave Joshua positive improvement from his limitationsfunction from C-5 was restored and from C-6 was improvingJoshua has not undergone any surgery for his injury and future surgery would yield no benefit since, as one of his treating doctors noted, by the age of 11 months Joshua seemed to be “correcting quite nicely on his own”The jury also awarded and the appellate court affirmed$380,000 for future loss of earnings.

"On October 25, 2008, Betty Luna boarded a city bus at Archer Avenue and Southern Boulevard in Queens. She paid the fare, began walking back to get a seat holding on to the pole and then shefell to the floor onto her right knee when the bus suddenly accelerated and pulled awayfrom the stop.The 47 year old Dr. Luna (a pediatrician then working in a Bronx child care clinic) was in excruciating pain. She remained on the bus floor for several minutes. Helped to a seat by fellow passengers, she continued on to her destination in the Bronx, hobbled home, iced her knee overnight and took a taxi to the local emergency room in the morning. She was diagnosed with a severelytorn meniscus.Dr. Luna sued the transit authority claiming that thebus driver negligently caused her to fall by suddenly, violently and without warning accelerating the bus.After a seven day trial in the Bronx, the jurors agreed and on May 3, 2012 returned a verdict awarding Dr. Luna$1,000,000for her pain and suffering damages ($500,000 past – 3.5 years, $500,000 future – 34 years).In a post-trial motion, the transit authority argued, successfully, that the damages award was excessive and thetrial judge ordered a reduction of the pain and suffering award to$350,000($100,000 past, $250,000 future).Plaintiff, not surprisingly, appealed contending that the trial judge’s reduction was drastic and totally unwarranted; furthermore, plaintiff urged the appellate court to order an increase in the future pain and suffering damages award to at least $700,000.Now, inLuna v. New York City Transit Authority(1st Dept. 2013), the$1,000,000 jury award for plaintiff’s pain and suffering has been reinstated. [The decision erroneously states that it was 7 years and 7 months from the date of the accident to the date of the verdict – it was 3 years and 6 months.]As set forth in the court’s decision, as a result of the accident,Dr. Luna’s torn meniscus required arthroscopic surgery(six weeks after she fell). During her surgery, a large portion of plaintiff’s right lateral meniscus was removed, leaving no cartilage in that area – “bone on bone” as one of her doctors described it.Dr. Luna was unable to work for three months, continues to experience significant pain andit is “most probable” that she will require a futureknee replacement.Inside Information:The defense conceded, and thetrial judge charged the jury, that the bus driver should be found negligent if indeed he suddenly, unusually and violently accelerated; however, it was claimed, unsuccessfully, that Dr. Luna fell because it waspouring rain at the timeand that she fell because of a wet, slippery floor on the bus (for which there would be no liability in this case).Plaintiff explained why she didn’t seek medical treatment until the next day: “Well, I’m a physician. I didn’t see a bone sticking out. I wasn’t unconscious. I wasn’t bleeding. I was embarrassed and I wanted to go home.”Plaintiff’s treating orthopedic surgeon, Stuart Hershon M.D., testifiedthat it was “possible” she’d need a total knee replacement whereas herpain management doctor, Stuart Kahn, M.D., testified much more definitively– he said it’s “highly likely.”Thedefense doctor, Julio Westerbrand, M.D., was board certified in orthopedic surgery but, due to his own medical condition, had to stop operating in 2004; he offered no opinion as to whether plaintiff will require additional surgery.In closing,defense counsel charged that plaintiff attempted to “play the race card”because “they don’t feel comfortable in their case. They want to try and influence things that don’t matter to try to win.” This was in response to plaintiff’s testimony –  “the bus driver was a white person”, “there is prejudice” and “I am Hispanic minority” –  suggesting that “prejudice” was the reason the bus driver, knowing she fell and seeing her writhing in pain on the bus floor, had not stopped the bus or otherwise helped her by lowering the exit platform.UPDATE: On April 3, 2014, the decision in this case was revised slightly. See,Luna v. New York City Transit Authority (1st. Dept 2014). The damages numbers stand but the period between the date of the accident and the date of the verdict was corrected (it was 3 years and 6 months, not 7 years and 7 months) and plaintiff’s doctor’s testimony as to her prognosis was corrected (he said it was “highly probable” she will require a future knee replacement not “most probable”).",1000000,"On October 25, 2008, Betty Luna boarded a city bus at Archer Avenue and Southern Boulevard in Queens.

"Hermine Browne, a 58 year old nurse’s aide, was experiencingexcruciating stomach painwhen she went to see her internist on February 17, 2001. The doctor diagnosed her withirritable bowel syndromeand prescribed medication. Unfortunately, the pain continued (and the same diagnosis was made) through March of 2002 when a sonogram and then a CT scan showed a largecancerous tumor, so extensive that only part could be surgically removed.After several years of treatment for the cancer, the tumor led to Ms. Browne’s death in September 2007.After a four week trial  in 2011, a Bronx County jury found that the doctordeparted from acceptedmedical practice by failing to timely order a CT scanin February 2001, therebyresulting in growth of the tumorto the point where it was unresectable and only palliative debulking of the tumor could be performed in May 2002.The jury awardeddamages in the sum of $880,000as follows:pre-death pain and suffering –$325,000economic loss to children –$555,000Thedefendant’s post-trial motion to vacate the jury verdict was granted. The trial judge found that the liability finding was against the weight of the evidence, in particular that the testimony of plaintiff’s expert oncologist was prejudicial and unfair and that plaintiff’s presentation of certain evidence resulted in undue surprise and unfairly prejudiced the defendant.On appeal, inRose v. Conte, (1st Dept. 2013), the juryverdict has been reinstated in plaintiff’s favor, both as to liability and as to damages.Thepre-death pain and suffering verdictwas based upon the decedent’s six years of pain, fear and emotional stress prior to her passing. During that time, Ms. Browne – a previously independent, hard-working woman who was the matriarch of a large family –  could no longer work, was constantly going to doctors, on extensive medication and in unremitting pain. Thedefense did not challenge the amount of this award.As toeconomic damages, Ms. Browne was survived byfive adult childrenranging in ages from 34 to 42 years. They claimed that their mother’s death resulted in economic damages to them from the loss of her nurture, care and guidance.So-calledloss of guidance damagesare typically awarded to young children; however, New York law (seeGonzalez v. New York City Housing Authority– Court of Appeals, 1991) provides thatthere is no prohibition to the award of loss of guidance wrongful death damages to adult children(even when they are financially independent) so long as there is adequate proof that the decedent provided more than occasional services to the children such as shelter, meals, advice and guidance.In this case,one of the surviving children, Richard Donalds (46 years old at the time of trial), was handicapped, having been, as plaintiff’s counsel put it, “grossly deformed [hands, feet and torso] as a result ofThalidomidetaken by his mother during her pregnancy.” Richard hadlived with his mother who provided extensive services to himincluding helping him get up when he fell due to his deformed feet, helping him to dress himself (he could not use his hands), cooking, shopping, driving and cleaning his clothes. The jury awarded – and the appellate court affirmed –$500,000 for Richard’s economic loss.Inside Information:Before she died, Ms. Browne had started the lawsuit and trial was underway.

On March 15, 2005, though, while working at a job site,scaffolding collapsedcausing Mr. Ciuffo to fall  to the ground and sustainserious foot and ankle injuries.In  his ensuing lawsuit, Mr. Ciuffo was granted summary judgment as to liability (based onLabor Law Section 240) and on June 6, 2011 a trial began limited to the amount of damages to be awarded.The Rensselaer County jury was presented with substantialevidence as to the 35 year old plaintiff’s injuries:completerupture of the left Achilles tendon, requiring surgerywithin two weekssix weeks in a non-walking cast plus six more in a walking bootanterior talofibular ligament tearrequiring reconstructive surgeryin December 2006 to remove an injured tarsal coalition and reconstruct the ligamenttwo more weeks in a non-walking castAchilles tendinosis– a thickening of the tendon due to abnormal scar tissuecontinuing pain and inability to return to prior activities such as running, walking on uneven surfaces and playing golf at a professional levelthird surgery recommended – to break up scar tissue and to accomplish tendon transfer in plaintiff’s Achilles tendonThejury awarded Mr. Ciuffo $53,000for his pain and suffering damages ($18,000 past – six years, $35,000 future – 35 years).Thetrial judge ruled that theaward for past pain and suffering was inadequateand ordered anincrease to $50,000(resulting in atotal award of $85,000).The defendant neither paid the $50,000 conditionally increased past damages award nor appealed from it. Therefore, there will be anew trial limited to the issue of past pain and suffering damages. It is scheduled to begin in September.Plaintiff appealed on the issue of future pain and suffering damages arguing that $35,000 was unreasonably low. InCiuffo v. Mowery Construction Co.(3rd Dept. 2013), however,$35,000 was affirmed as a reasonable sum for plaintiff’s future pain and suffering.The appellate judges conceded that the award is “relatively modest” but they justified it on the basis ofplaintiff’s post-accident activities. In particular, they agreed with the defense thatplaintiff’s new career as a golf professional(albeit at a driving range, not as a player) gave the jury a sufficient basis to award as little as $35,000 for plaintiff’s future damages. They were also impressed with the fact thatplaintiff sought no medical treatment following his second surgeryuntil a single visit with his surgeon three years later in 2010.Plaintiff argued that he needed to work to support his young family and that he did so in great pain and in a very limited fashion. He testified that he worked at the driving range only because he could no longer work in construction (he left the industry in 2006) and he was physically unable to pursue his dream of playing golf professionally.Inside Information:Normally, an employee is not permitted to sue his employer for personal injury damages in a case like this. Here, though, Mowery Construction Company (Mr. Ciuffo’s employer) did not carry workers compensation insurance in plaintiff’s favor so the usual ban did not apply.Five of the six jurors were college students(trial was held in June, when they were on school break); none were golfers.The court correctly noted that there is very little appellate case law regarding reasonable compensation for an Achilles tendon rupture and that the decision in the leading case,Kouho v. Trump Village Section 4, Inc., (2d Dept. 2012) did not mention the amount of future damages. Had the judges inquired, though, they would have discovered from my article on that case,here, or from a review of the public records in that case such as the judgment or the trial transcript, that the affirmed future damages  award in Kouho was $60,125 (three years).",85000,"James Ciuffo had been working as a laborer for a couple of years for Mowery Construction Company in the Lake George region.

"On March 24, 2007,Fitzroy Burnett was working for the transit authority as part of a track removal and replacement project in the subway tunnel at the 155th Street station in Manhattan. Burnett was attempting to remove shoring stuck in the concrete skeletonized track. Heslipped and fell backwards onto a trackdue to the presence of water that had been allowed to accumulate in his work area. As a result, the 51 year oldstruck his head, shoulder and backand was unable to get up due to severe ankle pain. Burnett was immediately taken by ambulance to the local hospital.Burnett sued the City of New York arguing that, underLabor Law 241(6),it was liable as the owner of a construction site that was unsafe due to the accumulated water. A Manhattan jury concluded that each side was equally at fault for the accident and awardedpain and suffering damages – before apportionment – in the sum of $250,000($175,000 past – four years, $75,000 future – one year).The defendant’spost-trial motionto have the verdict set aside on liability grounds was denied while theplaintiff’s cross-motion to increase the damages award  was granted.The judge determined that reasonable compensation for plaintiff’s pain and suffering was$300,000($210,000 past, $90,000 future),afterthe 50-50 liability split.InBurnett v. City of New York(1st Dept. 2013), the appellate courtaffirmed the liability apportionment as well as the trial judge’s increase of the pain and suffering damages award from $250,000 pre-apportionment to$300,000 post-apportionment(plus $200,000 for economic damages). Thus, the actual amount awarded to plaintiff for all damages stands at $500,000.At the hospital immediately after his accident, Burnett was diagnosed with afractured ankle.He was treated and released with a soft cast.Within three days of the accident, Burnett ended up in the hospital again after he suffered aprotractedgrand mal seizureat home. His treating neurologist testified that the seizure was caused by head trauma from the accident and his orthopedic surgeon testified thatconvulsive movements during the seizure seriously exacerbated a non-displaced shoulder fracture caused in the accident three days earlier. This testimony – unrebutted by any contrary medical testimony – was the major factor in the judicial determinations that the jury’s pain and suffering awards were inadequate.Here, then, are theinjury details:lateral malleolusankle fracture reduced via open reduction internal fixationwith plates and screwsfour partcomminuted humerus fractureand shoulder dislocation requiringhemiarthoplastic prosthetic replacement surgeryshoulderlabral and rotator cuff tearssurgically repairedunable to walk for several months without using a cane; as of trial, ankle still stiff and walking difficultextensivephysical therapy for ankle and shoulder for two yearsas of trial, shoulder pain was constant with movement, range of motion was severely restricted andshoulder function was diminished by 50%unable to enjoy cricket, play sports with his son or do his regular home handyman chorespost-traumatic seizure disorderrequiring lifelong medicationsInside Information:Plaintiff’s wife claimedloss of consortium damagesbut the jury declined to award her any damages at all.Plaintiff returned to worksix months after the accident (in an office position as a timekeeper, not as a trackworker) at the same salary he’d been receiving before.In effect, without explicitly so stating,the judges evaluated plaintiff’s total damages (pain and suffering plus economic) at $1,000,000. That is the only conclusion one can logically draw since the courts affirmed the 50-50 liability split and made clear that plaintiff was to receive after apportionment the sum of $500,000 for his damages.It does not appear that there was any evidence to support the trial  judge’s decision to increase plaintiff’s past and futureloss of earnings awardsfrom $81,500 (one-half of the jury award of $163,000) to $197,000 (equal to $394,000 before apportionment) and  the appellate court did not even address that issue. Perhaps the appellate court simply agreed with the $500,000 overall  net award to plaintiff ordered by the trial judge and had no interest in separately discussing the different items of damages.Since there was no evidentiary basis to affirm the trial judge’s increase of the economic damages awards, then one must conclude thatthe appellate court evaluated plaintiff’s pain and suffering damages at $919,000($1,000,000, representing the overall $500,000 award before apportionment,less$81,000, representingone-half of the past and future loss of earnings awards).

"On August 18, 2004,Burnett Williams was working for a lead abatement contractor at the 170th Street subway station in the Bronx. He was inspecting lead as old steel was being removed in connection with demolition and construction at the station and was injured when hestepped on and fell through temporary plywood flooring and his buttocks and back landed on a steel girding beneath the flooring.Williams, then 56 years old, claimed thatthe accident aggravated prior back injuriesthat had been quiescent but now required surgery.His ensuing lawsuit against the subway operator and general contractor (the City of New York and the Metropolitan Transit Authority) resulted insummary judgment for plaintiff under the provisions of Labor Law 240(1) and 241(6)because the flooring constituted  a hazardous opening that was not guarded by a cover fastened in place and plaintiff was not provided any device to protect against this height related injury.The matter then proceeded to atrial on damages onlythat resulted in a verdict on June 24, 2010. The Bronx Countyjury found that the accident aggravated plaintiff’s condition and that he was therefore entitled to pain and suffering damages in the sum of$3,200,000($1,200,000 past – six years, $2,000,000 future – 15 years).On appeal, inWilliams v. City of New York(1st Dept. 2013), the award forfuture pain and suffering damages has been reduced by $800,000.Two years before the accident, in 2002, Williams started experiencing low back pain. In May 2003, doctors diagnosed a herniated disc at L4-L5 that produced L5 radiculopathy.  A month later, the pain was so bad Williams stopped working for six months. After physical therapy and a series of epidural steroid injections, Williams was getting better and he returned to work in September 2003.Williams continued to work full time (albeit with some back pain) from September 2003 until his accident on August 18, 2004. Although he finished his work day (in great pain),Williams never again returned to any type of employment. His back pain got worse and worse and on March 1, 2005 he underwentlumbar discectomyin which his then larger than ever L4-L5 herniated disc was surgically removed.Lumbar Discectomy:While his radiating leg pain and weakness improved, his back pain returned. Pain management was attempted, unsuccessfully, with injections andintradiscal electrothermal therapy(IDET – an invasive procedure in which a catheter is threaded through a needle into the lumbar disc to heat it for 15-20 minutes).A provocativediscogramandlumbar fusion surgerywere performed in 2007.At trial, Williams told the jurors that his leg pain was much relievedand his back pain was somewhat relieved: “I have good days [four times a week] and bad days.” Good days meant he could walk outside, do some light shopping and run some errands. Bad days meant he woke up in pain that was so bad it lasted all day and he could do little more than lie on the floor wishing he were dead.Inside Information:Plaintiff’s attorney asked the jury to award $1,500,000 for past pain and suffering plus $2,250,000 for the future. Defense counsel argued that plaintiff’s condition was exacerbated only minimally as a result of the subject accident and that after the fusion surgery he returned to his pre-accident condition. Therefore, she asked that any award for past pain and suffering be “minimal” and that there be no award at all for the future.Defendant’spre-trial offer to settle was $125,000while plaintiff’s demand was $3,000,000.The defense argued that the jury’s award of $115,000 for future medical expenses was grossly excessive because after plaintiff’s fusion surgery in 2007 doctors had not recommended any significant additional treatment or surgery.

"On January 13, 2006 at about 1 p.m., Mohammed Kayes, then 44 years old, waswalking with his three year old daughter on the sidewalkadjacent to Queens Boulevard near 34th Street in Long Island City. Suddenly, a transit authoritytruck backed up and pushed over a 40 pound stop sign and pole that then dislodged and struck Kayes on his head and neck. He was knocked to the ground unconscious.In his ensuing lawsuit against the truck driver and the transit authority,Kayes was awarded summary judgment on the issue of liabilityand a jury trial on the issue of damages only was held in Queens County resulting in a plaintiff’sverdict in the sum of $2,000,000 for pain and sufferingdamages($500,000 past – four years, $1,500,000 future – 30 years).  Defendants appealed arguing that the award was excessive; however, inKayes v. Liberati(2d Dept. 2013), the jury verdict has beenaffirmed.Here are thedetails of plaintiff’s injuries and treatment:Large bruise on head with pain in neck, head and back requiring emergency ambulance transport to the local hospitalTreated in E.R. with neck brace and pain medication, discharged eight hours later after negative CT scanMedical clinic treatment after two sleepless nights in pain; treated with pain medications and referred to physical therapist where he was treated for nine months 1-2 times per weekContinuing neck and left arm pain withradiculopathy, spasms and significant loss of range of motion in neckMRI confirmsherniated disc at C5-6(impinging on nerves) and EMG confirms related left arm nerve damageEpidural steroid injectionsSurgery July 11, 2007: anteriorcervical discectomy and fusionin which the disc between C5 and C6 was removed, a piece of bone was inserted as a stabilizer and atitanium plate was screwed in to lock the two vertebrae togetherThe surgery helped reduce the pain in plaintiff’s left arm but it did not eliminate his neck pain. Mr. Kayes had continuing headaches, neck pain and burning pain on the left side of his head.

"On November 23, 2003, at about 8 p.m., Alicia Rutledge wasboarding a city busat the corner of 125th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. She claimed that the bus driver closed the doors on her when she was on the first step. Herarms were pinned by the doors of the suddenly moving bus and her body twisted. Alicia yelled to the driver to stop, he did so abruptly and then she entered the bus, took her seat and traveled to her stop.Getting on the BusThenext morning Alicia went to a hospital emergency roomcomplaining ofpain in her left arm and shoulder and an inability to feel her fingers. She was treated and released but remained in pain. Although she worked a few days over the next two weeks as a certified nurse’s aide assisting the elderly, her pain worsened and Alicia never returned to her job. She underwent MRI testing and wasdiagnosed with a herniated disc at L4-5 and bulging discs at C4-5 and C5-6.In January 2005, Alicia sued the bus operator, the New York City Transit Authority, and the case came on for trial in Manhattan on October 13, 2010. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, awarding herpain and suffering damages in the sum of$500,000($100,000 past – 7 years, $400,000 future – 20 years). The verdict has now been affirmed inRutledge v. New York City Transit Authority(1st Dept. 2013).This case is significant for several reasons. First, it is a relatively large pain and suffering award for a non-surgical spinal injury case (we discussed another such case previously,here). Second, inasmuch as this was a motor vehicle accident case, the so-called threshold as to minimum injuries had to be met by plaintiff (and the jury nearly dismissed the case finding that plaintiff met only one of the three categories delineated in thejury charge). Third, plaintiff’s treatment for her injuries appeared to be relatively minimal and with significant gaps.Here are theinjury and treatment details:chiropractic treatment until relocation to Atlanta in April 2004several epidural and trigger point injections, as well as nerve blockssevere back pain caused discontinuation of two sedentary jobs in Atlanta, one after four weeks and the other after three months; unable to work at all thereafter10 physical therapy treatments in 2008monthly pain management 2008-2010continuing headaches, neck and back stiffness and radiating paincontinued use of back brace and caneMark McMahon, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon, examined plaintiff one time, in 2010, a few months before trial.Dr. McMahon testified at trialand opined thatplaintiff’s injuries include:moderate (50%) to severe (67%)permanent decreased range of motion in her back and neckL4-5 herniateddisc compressing the spinal cordand exiting the nerve rootsC4-5 and C5-6bulges impinging on the nerve rootsinability to return to nursing careerneeds cervical and lumbar decompression andfusion surgeriesInside Information:George Paul, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon, testified for the defense.He examined plaintiff three months after the accident and testified at trial that his examination of Ms. Rutledge was 100% normal; he did not find anything wrong with her.  He admitted, though, that until he took the stand at trial,he had never seen any of plaintiff’s medical records or test results.The jury found that plaintiff met the 90-180 threshold category underInsurance Law Section 5102but that she had neither a significant limitation of use of a body function or system nor a permanent consequential limitation of use of a body organ or member. Thedefense argued (unsuccessfully) that the $400,000 future pain and suffering award should be reduced to reflect the jury’s findings of non-permanence and no significant limitation.Inclosing arguments,plaintiff’s attorney suggested an award for past pain and suffering in the range of $1,000,000 to $1,500,000 and for future pain and suffering in the range of $3,000,000 to $5,000,000.  Defense counsel argued that the bus driver was not at fault and that in any event plaintiff’s injuries did not meet the threshold and therefore “she’s not entitled to any money.”In addition to pain and suffering damages, the jury also awarded (and the defendant did not challenge)$200,000 for past and future loss of earningsand$100,000 for future medical expenses(apparently the cost of the two spinal fusion surgeries testified to by Dr. McMahon).",500000,"On November 23, 2003, at about 8 p.m., Alicia Rutledge wasboarding a city busat the corner of 125th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan.

"On July 21, 2000, Daniel Hernandez was working on a defective lighting fixture at a Great Neck construction site when hefell from a ladder and broke his leg. Henever recovered from his injury(it got worse and others developed too); he was never able to return to work. His damages lawsuit took eight years  to get to trial. And then it took another four years to conclude post-trial motions (we wrote about this case three years ago,here) and appeals.Now, inHernandez v. Ten Ten Co.(1st Dept. 2013), anappeals court has upheld the jury’s verdict awarding pain and suffering damages in the sum of$3,166,667($1,000,000 past – eight years, $2,166,667 future – 25.8 years).The appellate court decision lists the injuries sustained by Mr. Hernandez that persuaded the judges to uphold the substantial pain and suffering award. Here are theinjury details:tibia and fibula fractures– severe comminuted mid-shaft, open surgery with rod inserted from knee to ankle, fibula non-union requires future surgery and bone grafting, peroneal nerve injury, chronic and persistent pain, antalgic gait, needs crutches to ambulateback injuries– radiculopathy at L4-5 and S-1 confirmed by EMG, severe  persistent low back painreflex sympathy dystrophy (RSD)– progressively worsening chronic pain syndrome affecting both lower extremities, burning pain in legs and feet, discolored and dry, flaky skindepression– previously active and employed, now house-bound, reclusive and often crying, stupefied and drowsy from medications, unable to think straight or be attentivesleep disorder– cannot sleep without Ambiensexual dysfunction– no physical relations with wifePlaintiff’s counsel inHernandezargued on appeal thatSerrano v. 432 Park S. Realty Co., LLC(1st Dept. 2009), a case we discussedhere, is the closest comparable case that is instructive and persuasive insofar as relative injuries and awards are concerned. The judges inHernandezagreed, citing only theSerranocase as justification for upholding the awards to Mr. Hernandez.InSerrano, a 32 year old construction worker fell from a ladder and sustained severe wrist fractures requiring two significant surgeries leaving him with a functionally useless hand, a herniated disc also requiring surgery, RSD and depression. In that case, the jury awarded plaintiff pain and suffering damages in the sum of $4,840,000 ($600,000 past – six years.  $4,240,000 future – 38 years). The appellate court reduced the future damages to $2,500,000, resulting in a total affirmed award of$3,100,000.Inside Information:The jury’sloss of services award to plaintiff’s wifein the sum of$341,666was affirmed on appeal. Interestingly, this award was for past loss of services only; there was no award at all for future loss of services. The award is very high relative to other cases considering it represents a period of only eight years; however, when considering the jury’s finding that Mr. Hernandez’s pain and suffering will continue for 25.8 years, the loss of services award appears reasonable (and it was not specifically challenged on appeal). Apparently, the jurors were confused.Plaintiff was held to be 46.67% at fault for the accident– (with the remaining 53.33% charged to the defendant). Accordingly, Mr. Hernandez will receive a prorated reduced portion of the affirmed judgment.",3166667,"On July 21, 2000, Daniel Hernandez was working on a defective lighting fixture at a Great Neck construction site when hefell from a ladder and broke his leg.

Ten Ten Co.(1st Dept. 2013), anappeals court has upheld the jury’s verdict awarding pain and suffering damages in the sum of<redacted>(<redacted> past – eight years, <redacted> future – 25.8 years).The appellate court decision lists the injuries sustained by Mr. Hernandez that persuaded the judges to uphold the substantial pain and suffering award. Here are theinjury details:tibia and fibula fractures– severe comminuted mid-shaft, open surgery with rod inserted from knee to ankle, fibula non-union requires future surgery and bone grafting, peroneal nerve injury, chronic and persistent pain, antalgic gait, needs crutches to ambulateback injuries– radiculopathy at L4-5 and S-1 confirmed by EMG, severe  persistent low back painreflex sympathy dystrophy (RSD)– progressively worsening chronic pain syndrome affecting both lower extremities, burning pain in legs and feet, discolored and dry, flaky skindepression– previously active and employed, now house-bound, reclusive and often crying, stupefied and drowsy from medications, unable to think straight or be attentivesleep disorder– cannot sleep without Ambiensexual dysfunction– no physical relations with wifePlaintiff’s counsel inHernandezargued on appeal thatSerrano v. 432 Park S. Realty Co., LLC(1st Dept. 2009), a case we discussedhere, is the closest comparable case that is instructive and persuasive insofar as relative injuries and awards are concerned. The judges inHernandezagreed, citing only theSerranocase as justification for upholding the awards to Mr. Hernandez.InSerrano, a 32 year old construction worker fell from a ladder and sustained severe wrist fractures requiring two significant surgeries leaving him with a functionally useless hand, a herniated disc also requiring surgery, RSD and depression. In that case, the jury awarded plaintiff pain and suffering damages in the sum of <redacted> (<redacted> past – six years.  <redacted> future – 38 years). The appellate court reduced the future damages to <redacted>, resulting in a total affirmed award of<redacted>.Inside Information:The jury’sloss of services award to plaintiff’s wifein the sum of<redacted>was affirmed on appeal. Interestingly, this award was for past loss of services only; there was no award at all for future loss of services. The award is very high relative to other cases considering it represents a period of only eight years; however, when considering the jury’s finding that Mr. Hernandez’s pain and suffering will continue for 25.8 years, the loss of services award appears reasonable (and it was not specifically challenged on appeal). Apparently, the jurors were confused.Plaintiff was held to be 46.67% at fault for the accident– (with the remaining 53.33% charged to the defendant). Accordingly, Mr. Hernandez will receive a prorated reduced portion of the affirmed judgment.",315,3310
"On September 24, 2000,Thomas Burke fell from his wheelchair and injured his left foot. Mr. Burke, then 57 years old, had been afflicted with progressive multiple sclerosis for 20 years and had been wheelchair-bound since the mid-1990s. A week after he fell, Burke consulted with the first of several doctors about continuing leg pain. Unfortunately, he developedcompartment syndromeand on October 11, 2000 –less than three weeks after he fell – Burke’s leftleg had to be surgically amputatedbelow his knee.Compartment- SyndromeCompartment syndrome is a painful condition that occurs when pressure within the muscles builds to dangerous levels. If acute, it is a medical emergency requiring afasciotomyin which the surrounding skin and fascia (connective tissue) are cut open and away to relieve the pressure.Burke sued several physicians claiming malpractice but all were dismissed from his suit except an orthopedic surgeon, Wesley V. Carrion, M.D., who treated him one time, 11 days after the fall.Burke claimed that the orthopedic surgeon should have diagnosed acute compartment syndrome (“ACS”) and performed a fasciotomy. The defense contended that ACS is only acute for about seven hours after an injury and that thereafter it is medically inadvisable to operate.  The jury disagreed and on May 6, 2008 they returned averdict finding the defendant liable.The jury also: (a) assessedpain and suffering damages in the sum of$1,500,000($500,000 past – eight years, $1,000,000 future – 17 years) and (b) awarded plaintiff’s wifeloss of services damages in the sum of$750,000($250,000 past, $500,000 future).On appeal, inBurke v. Carrion(2d Dept. 2012), theliability finding and the pain and suffering damages awards were affirmed; however, theloss  of services awards were slashed to $20,000($15,000 past, $5,000 future).Plaintiff argued, successfully, that the pain and suffering awards should be sustained because, even though plaintiff was wheelchair bound for many years he had been “fiercely independent” and able physically in many respects (e.g., prepared his own lunches, washed dishes and drove his car) butafter the amputation he:was essentially immobilized in the hospital and in rehabilitation for approximately one yearwaswithout a prosthesis for a yearand during that time had to be moved by a Hoyer liftunderwentnine surgical procedures(three major surgeries on his lower leg and numerous debridements)sustainedglobal degeneration– the loss of most muscle strength and coordination throughout his bodybecame totally dependent on others for activities of daily living such as wheelchair transfers, showering and toiletingHoyer LiftThe defense argued, unsuccessfully, that the pain and suffering awards were excessive, and the 17 year future period too long, because ofa host of pre-existing conditions Mr. Burke was already suffering fromincluding: progressive MS, strokes, Bell’s Palsy, seizures  heart conditions and depression.Although the appellate court affirmed the pain and suffering damages, it ordered a drasticreduction of the plaintiff’s wife’s loss of spousal services and consortium verdict: from $750,000 to $20,000.Plaintiff argued on appeal that his wife’s derivative award was proper because Mr. Burke had, before the amputation, been “a loving husband and enjoyable partner” with “an intimate marriage [that] was transformed into a sad existence of caretaking, worry, and lack of normalcy and support.” Additionally, plaintiff argued that he could no longer perform any household chores.Thedefense argued, successfully, that there was insufficient evidence to support any significant loss of services awardclaiming that strokes before the amputation left Mr. Burke unable to handle the household finances, transfer from one spot to another or drive  a car and that he was already essentially immobile and in need of outside physical assistance.Inside Information:On May 24, 2009, justa year after the verdict was rendered, Thomas Burke died from brain cancer, a cause unrelated to his leg or malpractice claims. Under New York law requiring large future pain and suffering verdicts to be paid out over many years (and discontinued in the event of death), almost all of the future pain and suffering damages in this case in excess of $250,000 will not be due.Two months before the verdict inBurke v. Carrion, a different jury exonerated Dr. Carrion in a different case,Mistretta v. Carrion. In that case, a 15 year old who underwent a derotational osteotomy claimed that she developed compartment syndrome because peroneal nerve compression had not been addressed intra-operatively.

Nonetheless, Guallpa claimed he was suffering from back pain that radiated down his leg and he underwent a pain management program including opiate medications and epidural steroid injections.A year after the accident, an MRI showed a largeherniated disc at L4-5and he underwent alumbar diskectomyin November 2008.A left shoulder rotator cuff impingement injury was also claimed but it was treated without surgery and did not appear to be a major part of plaintiff’s case.Guallpa sued the building’s owner claiming liability underLabor Law Section 240(1)which requires building owners to furnish ladders to construction workers so as to provide the worker with proper protection. In this case, it was alleged that there was no safety device provided and no one securing the ladder.Summary judgment was granted to Guallpa in 2009 and adamages only trialwas held in October 2010The Queens Countyjury awarded plaintiff pain and suffering damages in the sum of$2,219,571($791,000 past –  4 years, $1,428,571 future – 28 years).The defendant appealed on the ground that the award was excessive; however inGuallpa v.

In other words,as charged by the judge: plaintiff was entitled to recover for theincreasedpain and disability resulting from the aggravation.In arguing against an award of future damages, defense counsel, in his summation, suggested that due to her pre-existing arthritis Ms.Algerio would have needed a knee replacement regardless of the current accident.He said that his clients ""should not have to continue to pay for things which would have happened anyway."" Clearly, the jurors agreed and the appellate judges found that there was enough evidence to support the conclusion that plaintiff was not entitled to any damages for future pain and suffering.Inside Information:Plaintiff’s attorney asked the jury to award <redacted>for pain and suffering damages (<redacted> past plus <redacted> future); whereas defense counsel suggested <redacted> (past only).Defense counsel attackedplaintiff’s credibilitybecause she falsely testified that she began taking an anti-depressant medication only after the 2007 accident. In fact she had been taking the drug for years before.Defense counsel questioned whether in fact plaintiff was telling the truth in view of theabsence of any corroborating testimony that plaintiff lived an active, pain-free life until the 2007 accident:  "" … no one from the company she works for, no neighbors to testify, no friends who witnessed them dancing ….""",325,4505
"On June 18, 2005, Luisa Sanchez was walking across 163rd Street in the Bronx when the28 year old woman was struck by a city sanitation truck.Ms. Sanchez was found by the truck driver lying in the street behind his truck.

City of New York(1st Dept. 2012), the appeals court held that Ms. Sanchez  ""showed some signs of consciousness, if not awareness"" and experienced ""some level of pain and suffering during her interludes of consciousness."" This was enough to require an award forpre-death pain and sufferingand the judges determined that$400,000is the minimum acceptable amount under the facts of this case.The appellate court also addressedadditional elements of damagesas follows:affirmed the $325,000 loss ofparental guidanceaward (on appeal, plaintiff had argued for an increase to $1,500,000)increased thelost earningsaward to include $77,000 for the period before deathincreased the future loss ofhousehold servicesaward from $150,000 to $300,000Parental guidance damagesare meant to compensate a child for the economic loss of a parent’s nurture and care as well as the physical, mental and intellectual training by a parent.

It showed Diarassouba walking in and our of his home and car.Plaintiff’s pain medicine expert, Alexander Weingarten, M.D., testifiedthat the chances that plaintiff would recover any more leg function are ""probably zero;"" whereas,defendants’ neurology expert, Samuel Rapoport, M.D., testifiedthat plaintiff’s RSD had improved and, based on the videotape, he could walk normally.While the jury was deliberating during the second trial, Diarassouba was willing to accept defendants’ <redacted> settlement offer that he had previously rejectedbecause he was convinced that the jury would be swayed by the testimony of Dr. Urban, the surgeon who had settled, that if anyone was to blame he was the one and not the anesthesiologists.",332,3513

Plaintiff’s doctor (Justin Greisberg, M.D.) stated that her injuries are permanent and that there is a high chance she will develop arthritis. He said the prognosis for a full recovery was poor because of scar tissue which was evidence ofchondromalacia(when bone cartilage softens and inhibits movement of a joint).The defense expert (Barbara Freeman, M.D.) stated that plaintiff had made a good recovery and could resume all of her prior activities without restrictions.In its decision, the court citedtwo prior relevant ankle fracture casesin which appeals were taken on the basis of excessiveness or inadequacy of pain and suffering damages –Alicea v. City of New York(1st Dept. 2011) andLowenstein v. Normandy Group, LLC(1st Dept 2008).In theAliceacase (discussed by us previously,here), the appellate result was$1,182,800. There, the court ordered anincreasein past pain and suffering damages (6 years) from $158,960 to $400,000 and affirmed the $782,800 award for future damages (38 years).

Ms. Lowenstein had fallen and sustained  a trimalleolar fractureanda shoulder fracture. She underwent open reduction internal fixation for her ankle but did not require surgery for her shoulder.

And, within four months, she was determined to have sustained amajor depressive episode.Then, theSocial Security Administration determined that, as of August 2003, Ms. Turuseta had become disabled(i.e., unable to do any substantial gainful activity because of her physical and/or mental impairments).In January 2008, a Westchester County jury determined that thebuilding owner and manager were negligentand fully responsible for plaintiff’s injuries because broken concrete near the door saddle was a dangerous defect that they knew of several months earlier and could have repaired for $200.The samejury then awarded Ms. Tursueta$80,000solely for herfuture medical expenseswhile awarding hernothing at all for her pain and suffering.The trial judge agreed with plaintiff  that theverdict awarding $80,000 appeared to be an impermissible compromise– how could a jury award her future medical expenses (the figure corresponded with the amount her doctors testified would be needed for future coccyx and spinal surgeries) but nothing for pain and suffering? The$80,000 verdict was set aside and a new trial ordered on the issue of damages.Ms. Turuseta testifiedthat the unremitting pain in her back and coccyx was not relieved with extensive pain medication, trigger point injections or facet block injections. She hobbled to the stand with a cane and said she was in substantial pain even while sitting on a pillow and using pain relief medicine.Her doctors testifiedthat she had substantial limitations bending and lifting and that she could not perform even light jobs.SSEP testsdemonstrated irritation of the nerve roots in her legs and Ms. Tursueta was diagnosed withlumbar radiculopathy, a chronic pain condition characterized by leg pain with tingling, numbness or weakness that travels from the low back through the buttock and down the large sciatic nerve in the back of the leg.On July 2, 2009,the second jury awarded plaintiff pain and suffering damages in the sum of$2,796,096($576,867 past – 6 years, $2,219,229 future – 28 years).Now, inTuruseta v. Wyassup-Laurel Glen Corp.

The appellate court also upheld theloss of earnings award in the sum of about $840,000and future household expenses in the sum of $90,000.Although reduced by more than $1,600,000, the resultingpain and suffering award of $1,150,000 nonetheless stands as a very significant sum upheld out of the usually conservative Westchester County for orthopedic injuries that hadn’t required surgery as of the trial date.Inside Information:In seeking to set aside the first verdict,plaintiff’s counsel proposed an amountof $1,000,000 for total pain and suffering – $900,000 for his client’s physical injuries plus $100,000 for her depression. In his summationat the second trial, counsel asked the jury to award $1,650,000 for pain and suffering(without suggesting a division between her physical and psychological injuries).At the time of her accident, Ms. Turuseta’s employer was her best friend and testified on her behalf.

Afteropening the driver side doorabout six inches, his car wasstruck by a passing city bus.Ramos was sitting in a 1987 Ford Thunderbird:Ramos was thrown to the other side of the car and claimed hehurt his back.Ultimately, Ramos sued the transit authority and on May 21, 2009, a jury found the bus driver 100% at fault for the accident and awarded plaintiff pain and suffering damages in the sum of$595,000($270,000 past – 8 1/2 years, $325,000 future – 9 years). Both the liability finding and the damages award were upheld on appeal last week inRamos v. New York City Transit Authority(1st Dept. 2011).As indicated in the decision, plaintiff was 59 years old at the time and he sustained multipleherniated discsin his lumbar spine that required acombined discectomy, laminectomy and spinal fusionfour years later.In alaminectomy, the surgeon removes the bony back wall of the affected spine, called the lamina and then in adiscectomy, the surgeon removes the disc itself:And here’s what the spine looks like after thelumbar fusion surgerywith the insertion of ametal plate and screws:In the appeal, thedefense argued, unsuccessfully, that (a) the liability verdict should be reversed becauseplaintiff should have seen the bus before he opened his car door into trafficand (b) in the alternative, thejury should have apportioned some of the fault to plaintiffbecause they found he was negligent (but that his negligence was not a proximate cause of the accident).As to damages, thedefense argued that the jury award was excessive in view of plaintiff’s preexisting conditions:degenerative disc disease(when aging discs become stiff and dry out)scoliosis(a sideways curvature of the spine)syrinx(a cavity in the spinal cord formed by cerebrospinal fluid)Plaintiff successfully countered each of the defense arguments as to damagesthrough the testimony of his expert neurologist who stated that:both thescoliosis and the syrinx were in plaintiff’scervicalspineand the likelihood that either of these conditions affected plaintiff’s lumbar spine was extremely remoteplaintiff showedno symptoms of preexisting low back pain problems and the fact that he had been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease two years before ths accident was of no consequence because there was no evidence (such as an MRI) that Ramos had a herniated disc before the accidentInside Information:Ramos refused medical treatment at the scene, reported to work that night as a doorman in an apartment building, continued to work for  a few more daysand did not seek any medical attention at all until three days laterwhen he presented to a neighborhood clinic complaining of significant lower back pain.There wereonly three witnesses at trial – plaintiff, a police officer and plaintiff’s medical expert, neurologist Ringa Krishna, M.D. The defense produced neither its bus driver nor any medical expert to rebut plaintiff’s claims and proof as to causation, pain, disability and permanency.Unfortunately, thesurgery failedand plaintiff’s condition got worse. He was diagnosed with chronic nerve damage and arthritis in his spine causing permanent low back pain and making it difficult to walk. Ramos never returned to work.Plaintiff was granted amissing witness chargeas to the defense physician who was engaged before trial but did not testify at the trial – the jury was told that it may infer that the defense doctor would not have supported the defendant’s position with respect to the medical issues and would not contradict the plaintiff’s medical evidence.",595000,"Luis Ramos wassitting in a parked carin the parking lane, on Claremont Parkway in the Bronx on September 24, 2001.

New York City Transit Authority(1st Dept. 2011).As indicated in the decision, plaintiff was 59 years old at the time and he sustained multipleherniated discsin his lumbar spine that required acombined discectomy, laminectomy and spinal fusionfour years later.In alaminectomy, the surgeon removes the bony back wall of the affected spine, called the lamina and then in adiscectomy, the surgeon removes the disc itself:And here’s what the spine looks like after thelumbar fusion surgerywith the insertion of ametal plate and screws:In the appeal, thedefense argued, unsuccessfully, that (a) the liability verdict should be reversed becauseplaintiff should have seen the bus before he opened his car door into trafficand (b) in the alternative, thejury should have apportioned some of the fault to plaintiffbecause they found he was negligent (but that his negligence was not a proximate cause of the accident).As to damages, thedefense argued that the jury award was excessive in view of plaintiff’s preexisting conditions:degenerative disc disease(when aging discs become stiff and dry out)scoliosis(a sideways curvature of the spine)syrinx(a cavity in the spinal cord formed by cerebrospinal fluid)Plaintiff successfully countered each of the defense arguments as to damagesthrough the testimony of his expert neurologist who stated that:both thescoliosis and the syrinx were in plaintiff’scervicalspineand the likelihood that either of these conditions affected plaintiff’s lumbar spine was extremely remoteplaintiff showedno symptoms of preexisting low back pain problems and the fact that he had been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease two years before ths accident was of no consequence because there was no evidence (such as an MRI) that Ramos had a herniated disc before the accidentInside Information:Ramos refused medical treatment at the scene, reported to work that night as a doorman in an apartment building, continued to work for  a few more daysand did not seek any medical attention at all until three days laterwhen he presented to a neighborhood clinic complaining of significant lower back pain.There wereonly three witnesses at trial – plaintiff, a police officer and plaintiff’s medical expert, neurologist Ringa Krishna, M.D. The defense produced neither its bus driver nor any medical expert to rebut plaintiff’s claims and proof as to causation, pain, disability and permanency.Unfortunately, thesurgery failedand plaintiff’s condition got worse. He was diagnosed with chronic nerve damage and arthritis in his spine causing permanent low back pain and making it difficult to walk. Ramos never returned to work.Plaintiff was granted amissing witness chargeas to the defense physician who was engaged before trial but did not testify at the trial – the jury was told that it may infer that the defense doctor would not have supported the defendant’s position with respect to the medical issues and would not contradict the plaintiff’s medical evidence.",351,3715

In pain with a lump on the side of her head and a swollen eye, she was taken byambulance to the local hospital where she was treated and released.Within the ensuing week, though, Kenzie was disoriented and dizzy and her head pain was debilitating.On September 6th, Kenzie sought treatment at the emergency room at which time a CAT scan was performed showing atemporal lobe contusionand asubdural hematoma.Kenzie’s injuries were thought to be minimal. Due to the hematoma, though, she was admitted for observation for two days and then discharged.Unfortunately, Kenzie got worse. Much worse.

Through expert testimony, he also claimed he was permanently incapable of taking care of himself andcannot live independently.Inside Information:Thedefense called only one medical witness to testify– neuropsychologist Thomas Boland, Ph.D.Plaintiff called several expertsincluding an orthopedic surgeon (Ira Esformes, M.D.), a neuropsychologist (Dustin Gordon, Ph.D.), a neurosurgeon (Douglas Cohen, M.d.), a vocational rehabilitation counselor (Ed Provder, Ph.D) and an economist (Frank Tinari, Ph.D.).Thedefense argued in summationthat the <redacted> for future medical expenses suggested by plaintiff’s experts was outrageously high and the product of incredible testimony, calculations and growth rates.Plaintiff was not a U.S. citizen; he’d come here from Ecuador two years before the accident and was undocumented. The defense was precluded from raising plaintiff’s immigration status under the recent ruling inBalbuena v. IDR Realty LLC(Court of Appeals 2006) but the defense nonetheless argued, unsuccessfully, that the jury should be allowed to consider whether plaintiff intended to return to Ecuador where medical care is socialized and his future medical costs would be nowhere near the <redacted> awarded by the jury for lifetime assisted living.Plaintiff’s counsel asked the jury to award <redacted> for pain and sufferingwhereas defense counsel suggested an award of <redacted>.",356,3821

Accordingly,summary judgment was granted to Colemanin 2007 and his case proceeded to a damages only trial in 2008.On November 7, 2008, a Bronx County jury awarded Coleman pain and suffering damages in the sum of$2,100,000($600,000 past – 3 years, $1,500,000 future – 20 years). The TA appealed, successfully arguing that the award was excessive.MRI reports showed that Coleman sustained the followingspinal disc injuries:herniated disc at C4-5,bulging annulus fibrosis at C5-6herniated disc at L5-S1.The defense doctors and attorney argued that plaintiff’s injuries were minor and any significant complaints of pain or disability he had were due only to degenerative changes in his spine.EMG testing and nerve conduction studies, though, showed nerve injuries –radiculopathy at C5 and C7.Plaintiff testified as to his current pain and limitations:constant pain which radiatesdown his right legstill takes narcotic medicationgetssteroid injectionsfor his back paincannot workcannot engage in sports he enjoyed such as bowling and basketballcannot carry shopping bagsColeman never had any surgery for his injuries in this casebut hisdoctor recommended that he undergo neck and back surgery– either adiscectomy or laminectomy with fusion– if his symptoms continued unabated by conservative treatment.InColeman v.

City of New York(2d Dept. 2011), an appellate court has agreed with the defense contention that the jury award was excessive andruled that the <redacted>award for future damages should be reduced by <redacted> to <redacted>.Thetotal award now stands at <redacted>(<redacted> past, <redacted> future).As indicated in its decision, theappellate court was influenced by the facts that:theclavicle fracture was only minimally displaced(where the bone snaps and moves, so that the ends are not lined up straight) andthehip fracture was nondisplaced(where the bone cracks, but does not move and maintains its proper alignment).Maria’s hip fracture was actually anondisplaced fracture of the greater trochanter(the non-weight bearing large bony end of the femur that sticks out from the side of one’s hip).The court also noted that Maria’streatment for her injuries was minimal(sling for six weeks, minimal physical therapy, no surgery), she hadno arthritis, shedid not limpand herfractures had healed completely.In arguing for anaffirmanceof the jury verdict, Maria’s attorneys noted that:she experiencespaina few times a week as well as upon changes in the weather, when jogging and when wearing high heelsher physical medicine and rehabilitation doctor (Kioomars Moosazadeh, M.D.) testified that Maria still has someatrophy and and instability in her shoulder with respect to which he said she has a guarded prognosisIn arguing (successfully) for areductionof the jury verdict, the defense noted that:there was no medical testimony establishing permanenceor arthritic changesthe evidence indicated that plaintiff’sinjuries have not had much of an impacton her activitiesthedefense doctor (orthopedic surgeon Andrew Miller, M.D.) testifiedthat he did not detect any atrophy, irritability or crepitation of Maria’s shoulderTwo of thecases cited by the courtare recent and relevant.InShaperonovitch v.

"On October 12, 2007, Tina Holstein delivered her third child, without complications, at Community General Hospital in Syracuse. Within a couple of hours, she was nauseous and vomited so the nurse on duty administered anintramuscular injection of Phenergan (an anti-emetic).Generally, aninjection into the buttocks is delivered using the upper outer quadrant,so as to avoid the sciatic nerve:In Mrs. Holstein’s case, theinjection was delivered in the wrong location – hitting the sciatic nerve– and she ended up with unremitting pain in her back and down her leg.Thesciatic nerve is the largest and longest single nerve in the body, about as big around as a man’s thumb at its largest point. It originates in the lower spine as nerve roots exit the spinal cord and extends all the way down the back of the leg to the toes.In an ensuing lawsuit against the hospital (and the nurse who gave the shot), on May 28, 2010, an Onondaga Countyjury found medical negligence against the defendants and awarded the then 34 year old Holstein pain and suffering damages in the sum of$1,690,000($140,000 past – 2 1/2 years, $1,550,000 future – 50 years).The defense claimed in a post-trial motion that (a) there was insufficient evidence to warrant the jury’s finding that the nurse was negligent and (b) the verdict was excessive.

"On August 13, 2006, George Nunez was working as part of a New York City Transit Authority crew replacing subway tracks in Brooklyn. Awalkway suddenly collapsed and he fell 30 feetto the street below, causing him to sustain numerous life-altering injuries.Nunez, 48 years old at the time of the accident, sued the City of New York and was granted summary judgment under New York’sLabor Law Section 240which protects workers from height-related accidents.In adamages only trial, the jury awarded Mr. Nunez$9,200,000for his pain and suffering ($3,000,000 past, $6,200,000 future). Thetrial judge conditionallyreduced the award to$5,500,000 ($1,750,00 past – 3 years, $3,750,000 future – 37 years)and that reduced sum has now beenaffirmedby the appellate court inNunez v. City of New York(2d Dept. 2011).Unfortunately, theappellate court failed to explainwhy the jury’s verdict should be reduced (other than its reference to the boilerplate language fromCPLR 5501that the figure set by the trial judge ""did not deviate from what would be reasonable compensation""). Additionally, the court did not reveal any of the injuries sustained by Mr. Nunez.We have uncovered thedetails as to Mr. Nunez’s massive injuries,including:Traumatic brain injury(TBI), with loss of consciousness, hemorrhage to his frontal lobe, hygromas and a temporal bone fractureBilateral wrist fractures– each with dislocation of the scaphoid lunates requiring open reduction internal fixation surgeries that failed, hardware removal andfusion surgery (arthrodesis) with dorsal plates (illustrated here)and more surgery plannedPelvic fractures (six)– bilateral inferior pubic rami and superior ramus on one sideFacial fractures– orbit, cheek and mandible, requiring surgery to place metal plates on the side of his faceAftertwo and a half months at Bellevue Hospital, Mr. Nunez was discharged in a wheelchair and transferred to arehabilitation center where he was treated for an additional month.Almost three years after the accident,Mr. Nunez testifiedthat he mainly just sat home watching television and was in constant pain at all of his fracture sites.His wife testifiedthat since the accident he was mentally slow, often distracted and suffered panic attacks. While he regained the ability to walk, she noted that her husband could not do many everyday tasks such as buttoning his shirt, opening a can or playing with their young children.As to thebrain injuries, there was testimony fromplaintiff’s expert neuropsychologist, Marcia Knight, Ph.D., who examined Nunez over a two day period one year after the accident. She concluded that he was left with asignificant neurocognitive disorderinvolving problems with attention and processing speed, and disturbance of executive functioning in terms of planning and higher thinking. She also diagnosed Mr. Nunez withresidual post-concussive disorder(causing problems with sleep, headaches, anxiety and depression). Finally, she notedasthenia(significant personality changes and lack of energy).Defense expert William Head, M.D.a psychiatrist and neurologist, examined plaintiff and his medical records and concluded that Mr. Nunez had no brain injury, or any neurological or psychological impairments, and that his neurological status did not prevent him from being gainfully employed.As to thewrist and other orthopedic injuries,plaintiff’s orthopedic expert Eric Crone, M.D., opined that Mr. Nunez is permanently disabled. He explained that the wrist fusion surgeries left plaintiff without any motion at all in his wrists, bilateral wrist pain and contractures in his fingers. Dr. Crone also noted that the pelvic fractures left Nunez withprogressive and permanent painthere and in his back.Defendant’s expert hand surgeon, Martin Posner, M.D., testifiedthat as a result of the wrist fusions plaintiff should no longer have pain in his wrists and that after surgery known as acapsulectomy(to release his ligaments), plaintiff should be able to flex his fingers to a much greater degree improving his ability to grasp things.Inside Information:Plaintiff’s attorney asked the jury to award $5,000,000 for future pain and suffering; instead they went further, awarding $6,000,000 for the future.Plaintiff never sought psychiatric or psychological therapy; nor was he given a prescription for antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication.In reducing theloss of services awardto Mrs. Nunez (from $1,500,000 to $350,000), the appellate judges cited no authoritative cases; however, they apparently rejected the applicability of two recent cases cited by plaintiff –Bissell v. Town of Amherst(4th Dept. 2008) [$1,00,000 for loss of services where spouse was paralyzed] andVillaseca v.

She concluded that he was left with asignificant neurocognitive disorderinvolving problems with attention and processing speed, and disturbance of executive functioning in terms of planning and higher thinking. She also diagnosed Mr. Nunez withresidual post-concussive disorder(causing problems with sleep, headaches, anxiety and depression). Finally, she notedasthenia(significant personality changes and lack of energy).Defense expert William Head, M.D.a psychiatrist and neurologist, examined plaintiff and his medical records and concluded that Mr. Nunez had no brain injury, or any neurological or psychological impairments, and that his neurological status did not prevent him from being gainfully employed.As to thewrist and other orthopedic injuries,plaintiff’s orthopedic expert Eric Crone, M.D., opined that Mr. Nunez is permanently disabled. He explained that the wrist fusion surgeries left plaintiff without any motion at all in his wrists, bilateral wrist pain and contractures in his fingers. Dr. Crone also noted that the pelvic fractures left Nunez withprogressive and permanent painthere and in his back.Defendant’s expert hand surgeon, Martin Posner, M.D., testifiedthat as a result of the wrist fusions plaintiff should no longer have pain in his wrists and that after surgery known as acapsulectomy(to release his ligaments), plaintiff should be able to flex his fingers to a much greater degree improving his ability to grasp things.Inside Information:Plaintiff’s attorney asked the jury to award <redacted> for future pain and suffering; instead they went further, awarding <redacted> for the future.Plaintiff never sought psychiatric or psychological therapy; nor was he given a prescription for antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication.In reducing theloss of services awardto Mrs. Nunez (from <redacted> to <redacted>), the appellate judges cited no authoritative cases; however, they apparently rejected the applicability of two recent cases cited by plaintiff –Bissell v. Town of Amherst(4th Dept. 2008) [<redacted>,00,000 for loss of services where spouse was paralyzed] andVillaseca v. City of New York(1st Dept. 2008) [<redacted> for loss of services where husband lost an eye].",366,4786

"On March 22, 2006 Alice Silverberg was admitted to Maimonides Hospital Center in Brooklyn. Up to that point, she was an active78 year old woman in generally good healthbut with a prolapsed uterus which brought her to the hospital for anelective vaginal hysterectomy.Anamaria Guzman, M.D., attempted to anesthetize Ms. Silverberg so the operation could commence but thedoctor was unable to place the endotracheal tube (ETT) in the trachea. Another anesthesiologist was called in to assist but he too was unable to intubate the patient.Three attempts were made but each time the instrument was placed into the esophagus (instead of the trachea).Finally, Dr. Guzman was able to successfully intubate her patient.

Guzman(Supreme Court, Kings County; Index # 24076/06), Ms.Silverberg claimed that the doctors were negligent in perforating her esophagusand that they thus caused her to undergo additional surgeries and a year of confined medical treatment unable to walk or feed herself as well as permanentdementia(the infection caused her to sufferhypoxic brain damage).On April 1, 2009, thejury found that Dr. Guzman departed from accepted medial practice(i.e., she was negligent) in failing to read notes in her patient’s chart and in failing, post-operatively, to communicate to plaintiff’s other doctors that medical instruments had been placed in the esophagus, thereby causing adelayed diagnosis of the esophogeal perforationfor several days.The jurors then awarded plaintiffpain and suffering damages in the sum of$4,500,000(allocated entirely to past pain and suffering with nothing at all awarded for any future period).Thedefendant appealedarguing:there wasno proof connecting the delayed diagnosis to plaintiff’s damagesandalternatively, that the pain and sufferingaward was excessive.InSemel v.

"In 2009, a Manhattan jury awarded 54 year old plumber Bill Bouzas$10,000for his pain and suffering (past – 2 years, future – zero) after a slip and fall accident left him with adislocated shoulder and rotator cuff tear surgery.Shoulder dislocation:Rotator cuff tears can be degenerative and caused by repetitive rubbing of bone spurs:We discussed the Bouzas case,here, and as we predicted, the trial judge’s refusal to modify the verdict upward was appealed.Last week, inBouzas v. Kosher Deluxe Restaurant(1st Dept. 2011), the$10,000 award was deemed inadequateand theappellate judges:ordered an increase to$100,000 forpastpain and suffering andaffirmed the jury’s refusal to make any award  forfuturepain and sufferingTheissues on appealwere not uncommon – to what extent a plaintiff may recover pain and suffering damages when there’s evidence that he:previously injuredthe same body part (here, the shoulder) orhad pre-existing significantdegenerative changesin the area.There was no question that Bouzas’s  shoulder was dislocated in the fall.Shoulder dislocations are very painful and they must be reduced (put back into place), often, as here with a very painful manipulative procedure.Thedefense contended that themedical evidenceshowed the rotator cuff tear pre-existed the fall, was due to degenerative disease of the joint and was not related to the slip and fall trauma.Excerpts from the medical testimony (treating orthopedic surgeon Mark Klion, M.D. and the defense expert Jerry Lubliner, M.D.) are included in the defendant’s brief on appeal, here.Plaintiff testified that he had no prior shoulder problemsor limitations whatsoever but that since the accident he can’t lift his arm straight up, doesn’t have nearly the strength he used to and is significantly restricted in his job – especially so as to the overhead work often required in plumbing. Thejury, though, was evidently persuaded by plaintiff’s own surgeon’s records which showed that he already had ""extensive degenerative changes"" in his rotator cuff.The appellate court citedtwo casesas to damages.Shifrel v. Singh(1st Dept. 2009) – a 49 year old man’s $5,000 pain and suffering award (all past – 4 years) was ordered increased to$50,000(all past) after a car accident and torn rotator cuff surgery. The defense argued and the court noted that thejury was entitled to decline to make an award of future damagesin view of the testimony of the  defense biomechanical engineering expert that it was unlikely plaintiff struck his shoulder on the steering wheel in the accident.Miller v.

New York City Transit Authority(2d Dept. 2011), the appellate judges have now rejected the defense arguments as to the evidence issues and, accordingly, theyaffirmed the jury’s finding that defendant was 80% at fault.Theappeals court also reduced the future damages verdict to <redacted>, agreeing with the defense that the trial judge’s <redacted> reduction of the jury’s award for future pain and suffering was not enough.Walla’s total pain and suffering recovery has thus been reduced to <redacted>– 80% of the <redacted> gross award (<redacted> past, <redacted> future).Unfortunately, there wasno mention in the appellate court decision as to the nature of the injuriesother than a statement that Walla sustained “serious injuries.”  We have uncovered the facts.Injuries Details:When Walla was struck by the bus, it pushed or threw her several feet and one of its tires ran over her right leg.The injuries were indeed serious – amassive degloving injury of the full length of her right leg.This was ahorrendous injuryin which soft tissue, down to the bones, including neurovascular bundles, were literally torn away and peeled off from her upper groin down to her mid-calf.Here are the other undisclosed injury facts:on the street, Walla saw theentire musculature of her upper thigh exposedand was in excruciating pain as she “could literally feel [her] skin getting ripped off, [her] fat, [her] muscle”when ambulance personnel arrived, they struggled to free her leg, whichadhered to the surface of the roadwayshe was taken to Lutheran Medical Center where she remained for a month and underwentthree excruciatingly painfulsurgical debridementsshe was then sent to New York – Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan where she stayed an additional five weeks and underwentthree more surgical proceduresincluding debridements and the application ofskin grafts, spending much of her time in the burn unit and tankshe wasdischarged to home in a wheelchair, unable to walkand for six months thereafter underwent extensive and painful physical therapyshe wasconfined to her home for nine monthson both IV and oral narcotic pain medicationsshe missed one year of college and at the time of trial wasleft with exquisite pain, horrific disfigurement, a limp and parasthesiato her entire right leg with 30% reduced range of motion and the need to use a cane to walkInside Information:Continue ReadingMassive Leg Injuries Result in <redacted> Jury Verdict for Pain and Suffering; Recovery Reduced to <redacted> after Appeal and Apportionment for Comparative Liability",380,4152
"George Jones died on November 21, 2003at the age of 51 years. His body was found (alone) two days later in his Bronx apartment andtaken to the city’s medical examiner’s office (the morgue) where an autopsy determined he’d died of natural causes. His mother, Lucille Jones, was notified and two of her other children went to the morgue for the grim purpose of identifying their brother.Mrs. Jones then planned a wake and an open casket funeral for November 28th. On November 25th, though, when the funeral director showed up at the morgue to pick up the body, he was advised that thebody of Mr. Jones was missing from the morgue. For more than a week, his whereabouts were unknown.Eventually, on December 2nd, Mrs. Jones was informed that her son had been transported out of state and buried in a potter’s filed in Pennsylvania. It turned out that themorgue had negligently released the body of Mr. Jones to the wrong funeral home– one that had come to pick up the body of a different man (named Jorge Jones).A proper funeral for George Jones was never held. He was exhumed and returned to New York but by then his body was badlydecomposed and he had to be crematedon December 8th.Mrs. Jones brought a lawsuit —Jones v. City of New York(Supreme Court, Bronx County; Index # 8009/05) — in which she claimedemotional distress damagescaused by the city’s wrongful interference with her right to the immediate possession of her son’s body for burial and her ability to see him one last time and pay proper respect.Liability against the city was determined in May 2008 in amotion for summary judgment decisionand then, on February 13, 2009, after a two day trial solely on the issue of damages, the jury awarded Mrs. Jones$800,000for her emotional distress pain and suffering.As to her emotional distress damages,Mrs. Jones testified that:she wasdevastatedupon learning that her son’s body was missingthe cremation of her eldest son had aprofound effectupon hernormally a lively woman who loved to cook and play with her grandchildren, she wasnot herself for more than a yearshelost more than 40 poundsAfter the trial, the defendant argued that the damages award was excessive but the trial judge issued adecisionon August 24, 2009 denying the motion. An appeal followed.Now, inJones v. City of New York(1st Dept. 2011), the appellate court has ruled that $800,000 is excessive and that there should be areduction to$400,000.Despite the substantial reduction by the appellate court, the $400,000 award is substantial and significant:The two prior appeals court decisionscited by the court ruling on damages in similar cases could have led the judges to slash the verdict even further. InDuffy v. City of New York(1st Dept. 1991), a $1,500,000 verdict was reduced to$250,000for the negligent withholding of the news of the death of plaintiff’s son for 18 months, thereby depriving plaintiff of the right to take possession of the body for a proper burial. And inEmeagwali v. Brooklyn Hospital Center(2d Dept. 2009), pain and suffering damages for parents in the sum of $1,900,000 were reduced to$350,000where the defendant improperly disposed the remains of a stillborn fetus, thereby depriving the plaintiffs of a chance to conduct a religious burial ceremony for their child and causing them emotional distress.Plaintiff offeredno medical testimony at all substantiating her claims of emotional distress. She’d neither treated with any physician or therapist nor sought counseling from, or even described the events to, her pastor with whom she was very close. InEmeagwali v. Brooklyn Hospital Center, for example, there was extensive testimony from a physician as to the mother’s psychological injuries, including severe depression and inability to leave the house. The defense sought to make much of the lack of any similar corroborating testimony to support the emotional distress claims of Mrs. Jones but the jury was obviously unimpressed with that argument and convinced of the genuineness of plaintiff’s claims.Inside Information:In his closing argument, thedefense attorney suggested that plaintiff was exaggeratingher damages for financial gain and that plaintiff’s ""sadness"" may be worth no money at all, just a heartfelt apology.In her closing argument, plaintiff’s attorneyDenise M.

"Leshai Ryalswalked out from the rear door of a city buson University Avenue in the Bronx on January 19, 2004 at about 11:30 a.m., took two steps in the street andthen slipped on snow and ice. She broke her ankle and sued claiming that the bus driver was liable because, having failed to pull up to the bus stop (he dropped her off 10 to 15 feet from the curb), he breached his duty to provide her a reasonably safe place to disembark.Here’s abus letting passengers off away from the curbbut without any snow or ice in the street:InRyals v. New York City Transit Authority(Supreme Court, Bronx County, Index # 21244/04) the busdriver claimed that he could not pull up to the bus stop curb because it was blockedby an 18 wheeler milk truck whose operator was making a delivery to the C Town supermarket on the sidewalk.At the trial in March 2009, the supermarket manager testified that there was space in front of the stop for the bus driver to park and that his employees had shoveled a path for people to get from the curb to the street. Based on that testimony, thetrial judge granted plaintiff’s motion for a directed verdict on liability.She ruled that the defendant was fully liable for the accident and therefore there was no need to submit that issue to the jury.The only questions submitted to the jury were related to damages. They then awarded the 37 year old Ms. Ryals  pain and suffering damages in the sum of$400,000($250,000 past – 5 years, $150,000 future – 5 years).The defendant appealed, arguing that the trial judge should have let the issue of liability be determined by the jury. The appellate court agreed and inRyals v. New York City Tr. Auth.(1st Dept. 2010), theliability verdict has now been reversed and the matter remanded for a new jury trial on the issue of liability.In general, trial judges may grant amotion for a directed verdictonly when there isnorational process that would lead the jury to find for the non-moving party. In this case, theappellate judges stated that a rational jurycouldhave rendered a defense verdict on liability– they could have found that the bus driver dropped off his passengers at the safest location under the circumstances.Theappeals court did not disturb the $400,000 damages verdictso on retrial that figure will apply to the new liability verdict.The decision did not, though, mention theinjuries sustained by the plaintiffso here are the details:trimalleolar ankle fractureopen reduction surgerywith internal fixation of syndesmotic screwssecond surgeryto remove the screwsunable to work as telecommunications provider’s manager for 3 1/2 monthsThe ankle joint is a hinge joint that consist of three bones: the tibia, the fibula and the talus.The bottom (distal) end of the fibula forms thelateral malleoluswhich is the bump on the outside of the ankle.The distal end of the tibia forms themedial malleoluswhich is the bump on the inside of the ankle.And theposterior malleolusis the back of the tibia at the level of the ankle joint.When all three malleoli are broken, it’s called atrimalleolar fracture:The award in this case is in line with sustained awards for pain and suffering inother cases dealing with trimalleolar fractures, such as:Fishbane v.

She broke her ankle and sued claiming that the bus driver was liable because, having failed to pull up to the bus stop (he dropped her off 10 to 15 feet from the curb), he breached his duty to provide her a reasonably safe place to disembark.Here’s abus letting passengers off away from the curbbut without any snow or ice in the street:InRyals v. New York City Transit Authority(Supreme Court, Bronx County, Index # 21244/04) the busdriver claimed that he could not pull up to the bus stop curb because it was blockedby an 18 wheeler milk truck whose operator was making a delivery to the C Town supermarket on the sidewalk.At the trial in March 2009, the supermarket manager testified that there was space in front of the stop for the bus driver to park and that his employees had shoveled a path for people to get from the curb to the street. Based on that testimony, thetrial judge granted plaintiff’s motion for a directed verdict on liability.She ruled that the defendant was fully liable for the accident and therefore there was no need to submit that issue to the jury.The only questions submitted to the jury were related to damages. They then awarded the 37 year old Ms. Ryals  pain and suffering damages in the sum of<redacted>(<redacted> past – 5 years, <redacted> future – 5 years).The defendant appealed, arguing that the trial judge should have let the issue of liability be determined by the jury. The appellate court agreed and inRyals v. New York City Tr.

In this case, theappellate judges stated that a rational jurycouldhave rendered a defense verdict on liability– they could have found that the bus driver dropped off his passengers at the safest location under the circumstances.Theappeals court did not disturb the <redacted> damages verdictso on retrial that figure will apply to the new liability verdict.The decision did not, though, mention theinjuries sustained by the plaintiffso here are the details:trimalleolar ankle fractureopen reduction surgerywith internal fixation of syndesmotic screwssecond surgeryto remove the screwsunable to work as telecommunications provider’s manager for 3 1/2 monthsThe ankle joint is a hinge joint that consist of three bones: the tibia, the fibula and the talus.The bottom (distal) end of the fibula forms thelateral malleoluswhich is the bump on the outside of the ankle.The distal end of the tibia forms themedial malleoluswhich is the bump on the inside of the ankle.And theposterior malleolusis the back of the tibia at the level of the ankle joint.When all three malleoli are broken, it’s called atrimalleolar fracture:The award in this case is in line with sustained awards for pain and suffering inother cases dealing with trimalleolar fractures, such as:Fishbane v.

"On July 29, 2005, Helen Garber beganextensive treatment in a dental office on 57th Street in Manhattan known as Toothsavers, a practice established by Jerry Lynn, with 50 employees including numerous dentists.Over the next few months, the 71 year old Ms. Garber was treated at Toothsavers under a comprehensive plan that included implants, caps and permanent bridgework. By November apermanent bridge was made but it didn’t fit. It had to be revised three times. Finally, in February 2006, Garber left Toothsavers and never returned.She sued for malpractice in April 2006 (Garber v. Lynn, Supreme Court, New York County, Index # 105673/06) and two years later a Manhattan jury found that there had indeed beenmalpractice (in the fit and placement of the temporary bridge)and plaintiff was awardedpain and suffering damages in the sum of$25,000($10,000 past – 3 years, $15,000 future). She was also awarded $75,000 in past and future dental expensesand $260,000 in punitive damages.Now, on appeal, inGarber v. Lynn(1st Dept. 2010), the liability verdict has been affirmed while the pain and suffering award has been increased to$150,000($90,000 past, $60,000 future),the punitive damages award upheld but reduced to $100,000and the dental expenses award affirmed.Here are the details of plaintiff’s injuries:severepainswelling of gumswhich bleed easily, pull away from the bone and trap bacteriaimpairment of ability to chewinability to cleanthe area around the bridgePlaintiff established that to restore the damage sheneeds more than 20 additional implants and 14 crowns.Thedefense arguedon appeal (unsuccessfully) that the pain and suffering award should not be increased, in part, because Ms.Garber had failed to mitigate her own damages in that she worean ill-fitting, painful temporary bridge for three years without seeking new treatment. Thus, they claimed, the jury was justified in concluding plaintiff acted unreasonably and, accordingly, discounting her claims of pain and suffering. This argument was rejected by the appellate court.The affirmance of thepunitive damages award is significantbecause, as New York’s highest court held inMcDougald v. Garber(1989), they are prohibited unless the harmful conduct is intentional, malicious, outrageous or otherwise aggravated beyond mere negligence. And, as was held inBothmer v. Schooler, Weinstein, Minsky & Lester, P.C.(1st Dept. 1999), even where there is gross negligence, punitive damages are awarded only in singularly rare cases such as those involving an improper state of mind or cases involving wrongdoing to the public.Defense counsel argued that the conduct of Toothsavers was, at worst, mere negligence, and nowhere near the severe standards required for the imposition of punitive damages. The key to the punitive damages award in this case, though, was the fact thatit was a Toothsavers technician –not a licensed dentist– who always fit, placed, adjusted and re-cemented plaintiff’s temporary bridge.The appellate court noted that theunlicensed practice of dentistry is a crimeand the jury was therefore free to conclude that Toothsavers was ""callous in its indifference to such illegality"" by having a mere technician repeatedly conduct complicated procedures such as fabricating, placing and adjusting the bridge.This, the court concluded, is precisely the sort of willful or wanton negligence or recklessness that warrants deterrence and an award of punitive damages.Inside Information:Ms.Garber had gone toToothsaversonly to ask about repairing two chipped front teeth. After an examination, she was told she needed a whole lot more dental work including implants, caps and permanent bridgework. A $25,000 fee was quoted.When she said she couldn’t afford $25,000, the fee was adjusted down to $5,000 – and treatment began that day.Jerry Lynn and Toothsavers were notorious long before Helen Garber walked in the door.

"He was a tough 47 year old steel cutteremployed for many years at the Goodyear-Dunlop plant in Tonawanda, New York (the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area) when in 2004 he noticed his right arm was swelling. After visits to a local ER and his primary care doctor, Richard Winiarski ended up seeing a vascular surgeon who told him he had a blood clot andthoracic outlet syndrome, pain in the arm and shoulder areas caused by a rib compressing upon a subclavian blood vessel.Here is the involvedanatomy:The doctor successfully treated the clot over the next six months with blood thinning medication and an injection (known as a lytic procedure). All seemed fine but she recommended arib resection operationto prevent a recurrence of the blood clot. The surgery involved removing the first rib so as to allow more space for the blood vessel.During surgery, though, thedoctor did not identify the thoracic nerve(which runs through the belly of the middle scalene muscle) and thenerve was damagedwhen she cut through the muscle using anelectrocautery device– a surgical tool which is heated with electric current to cauterize, or burn, vessel tissue.Immediately after the surgery, Mr. Winiarski had tremendous pain in the area of his scapula (or ""shoulder blade"") and within two weeks at physical therapy he was seen to havescapular winging(in which the scapula protrudes at rest or with arm and shoulder movement).In themedical malpractice lawsuitthat followed (Winiarski v. Harris– Supreme Court, Erie County, Index #3375/07), the jury found that the thoracic nerve had been injured by the surgeon  whose failure to identify the nerve was malpractice.

(Supreme Court, Bronx County; Index # 14520/01) returned averdict finding that the surgeon had committed malpractice in unnecessarily performing a mastectomyand that he did so without properly informing his patient of other options.The jury found that Ms. Williams was not given the option of alumpectomy(in which a small incision is made and the rest of the breast remains intact):Williams was awarded pain and suffering damages in the sum of$6,500,000($3,000,000 past – 8 years, $3,500,000 future – 42 years). In apost-trial decision, Justice Cynthia S. Kern agreed with the defense that the damages award was excessive and ordered areduction to $1,000,000.This week, inWilliams v. New York City Health & Hospitals Corp.(1st Dept. 2010), the appellate court hasaffirmedboth the liability finding and the trial judge’s reduction of the damages award to $1,000,000.Here are some details as to theplaintiff’s injuries:complete surgical removal of her left breastpermanent scarring and disfigurement across abdomen and breastsignificant post-op pain requiring a morphine pump and constant pain to the date of trialchronic pain and swelling in her left arm, symptomatic oflymphedemarestricted social and athletic activitiesThe appellate judges split 3-2 in their decision. The majority justified the $5,500,000 reduction of the jury award simply by referring to (but not discussing the relevance of) three prior cases that bear factual similarities and by stating that there was no trial testimony establishing that plaintiff had suffered extreme emotional distress.Here are the three cases cited by the majority:Motichka v. Cody(1st Dept. 2001) –$850,000reduced from $2,250,000 for unnecessary modified radical mastectomyKing v. Jordan(3d Dept. 1999) –$800,000upheld for unnecessary mastectomyLopez v. Bautista(2d Dept 2001) –$1,000,000for failure to diagnose cancer, later requiring a mastectomyThe foregoing cases are all about 10 years old and in certain respects they are factually distinguishable from theWilliamscase. Lydia Williams was 32 years old at the time of her trial and unmarried; whereas, Ms. Motichka was 45 years old when she underwent her mastectomy, Ms. Lopez was 42 and married and Ms. King was 52 and married. Furthermore, Ms. Williams was cancer free free after her chemotherapy and need not have sufferedanydisfigurement while the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs in the other cases were of degree (they would have suffered less disfigurement and less pain). The appellate judges discussednoneof these facts.The twodissenting judgesfound that the graphic, unsettling photos of plaintiff’s body taken a few months after the surgery (that were shown to the jury) obviated the need for any extensive testimony by plaintiff or a psychologist regarding herextreme emotional distress. They stated that extensive testimony regarding plaintiff’s emotional damages might have been overkill and that it was obvious (a ""universal truth"") that plaintiff’s physical injuries and disfigurement resulted in tremendous lifelong psychological damages. The dissenting judgeswould have approved a pain and suffering award of $4,000,000.Inside Information:Plaintiff’s attorney asked the jury for $4,000,000in pain and suffering damages for his client (and I hear that plaintiff would have accepted $1,200,000 before trial).Defense counsel stated in his closing that not only was there no malpractice but also ""the doctors in this case absolutely, absolutely saved the life of Lydia Williams.""Thedefense argued (unsuccessfully) that there was animproper attempt to inject race into this case – plaintiff’s attorney, in his closing argument, had stated that Ms. Williams was a poor Jamaican without insurance and that poverty and race have an impact on whether patients get the option of breast conserving treatment.",1000000,"She moved to New York City from Jamaica as a 29 year oldand within the year she felt a lump on her left breast.

"Janice Worthen-Caldwell worked for many years as amanager at a home health care agencywhich provides home health aides to ill or disabled patients in New York City. She was responsible for ensuring that more than 2,000 aides met required standards. In 2006, shesued her employer claiming that the owner had engaged in a pattern of sexual harassmentand unwanted and offensive touching dating back to 1990.Plaintiff, a 50 year old mother of two,claimed that her 57 year old boss made sexually explicit comments and demanded sexual favors from her as a term of employment. This behavior, she claimed, created a hostile work environment, and entitled her to damages under the State Human Rights Law –New York State Executive Law Section 296.A Kings County jury found for the defense on the State claim, but for the plaintiff on the City Human Rights Law claim added to the case mid-trial (see Inside Information below) and inWorthen-Caldwell v. Special Touch Home Care Services, Inc.(Supreme Court, Kings County, Index # 5012/06), plaintiff was awardedf$1,860,000for herpain and suffering resulting from the sexual harassment($1,300,000 past – 19 years, $560,000 future – 11 years).While thedefendant denied the charges of harassment(13 current and former employees testified that plaintiff and her witnesses fabricated facts), plaintiff testified that, on various occasions over the years, the owner:sexually assaulted her in the office by forcibly pulling her against himslid his hand across her rear endforcibly kissed herengaged in sexual activity with other women in the office during work hoursThis entire matter came to a head in September 2005 after plaintiff returned from a medical leave that year and was transferred from her position as a manager of quality assurance to the accounts receivable department.Plaintiff’s expert psychiatrist (who was recommended to her by her lawyer after the alleged harassment ended) testified that the sexual harassment caused:Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)– feelings of shock and numbness that are permanent and resulted in nightmares and flashbacksMajor Depression–  with symptoms including insomnia, irritability, low self-esteem, changes in appetite, sleep, cognition and suicidal ideationsPlaintiff was prescribed powerful medications –Zoloft, for depression andAtivanfor anxiety.On appeal, the defense argued that the $1,860,000 pain and suffering award was grossly excessive and now, inWorthen-Caldwell v. Special Touch Home Care Services, Inc. (2d Dept. 2010), the pain and suffering award was conditionallyreduced to$250,000($200,000 past, $50,000 future). The decision cites no reason for the reduction.Here are some of the few appellate court cases on the issue of appropriate pain and suffering damages for sexual harassment:New York State Dept. of Correctional Services v.

Blue(4th Dept. 2000) –$400,000reduced from $800,000 for female nurse who suffered from major depression, panic disorder and PTSDMs. Worthen-Caldwell’s attorney argued that $1,860,000 was a reasonable award in view of the$11,500,000verdict in the case ofSanders v. Madison Square Garden(U.S. District Court, S.D.N.Y., # 06 Civ. 589), tried in 2007; however, that notorious and well-publicized case (involving New York’s professional basketball team, the New York Knicks), was settled without an appellate resolution and the verdict was for punitive damages not pain and suffering.Inside Information:thetrial lasted four monthsand included 20 witnessesplaintiff first saw a psychiatrist a few months after she started her lawsuit, was referred to him by her lawyer and saw him a total of 15 times with an additional 20 telephone consultationsthedefense argued strenuously on appeal but without avail that it was unfair to allow plaintiff to add during trial a claim for violation of the newNew York City Human Rights Law(construed for the first time inWilliams v.
