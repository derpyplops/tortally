    Case Background
    The case revolves around an incident that occurred on June 20, 2023, at approximately 9:30 a.m. Emily Smith was boarding an MTA subway train at the Times Square Station when she alleges that the subway doors closed prematurely, trapping her right arm and causing severe injuries. Ms. Smith claims that she was trapped for approximately five minutes before a subway worker manually opened the doors to release her arm. She sustained significant injuries, including a broken arm, ligament damage, and nerve damage, which required surgical intervention and ongoing physical therapy.

    Plaintiff's Argument
    Negligence: The Plaintiff claims that MTA's failure to maintain and properly operate its subway equipment constitutes negligence. She asserts that the sensors on the subway door should have detected her arm and prevented the doors from closing, as is the case with newer models of subway trains.

    Emotional Distress: Ms. Smith alleges that the incident caused her extreme emotional distress, exacerbated by the duration for which she was trapped and the crowd of onlookers who were witness to the incident.

    Medical Expenses: The Plaintiff argues that the injury led to high medical expenses, including but not limited to hospital bills, surgical costs, and ongoing physical therapy.

    Lost Wages: Ms. Smith has had to take an extended leave from her job and claims loss of income due to her inability to work.

    Defendant's Argument
    Comparative Negligence: The MTA contends that Ms. Smith bears some responsibility for the incident by not stepping clear of the subway doors despite verbal and written warnings prominently displayed within the station and on the subway cars.

    Technical Limitations: The Defendant states that the train in question was an older model and that its sensors function within the limitations of the technology available at the time of its manufacture. They argue that the train met all safety guidelines and regulations at the time of the incident.

    Adequate Safety Measures: MTA asserts that they have adequate safety measures in place, including verbal announcements and signs warning passengers to stand clear of the doors.

    No Liability for Unforeseeable Harm: The Defendant claims that Ms. Smith's emotional distress was an unforeseeable consequence of a relatively common incident and that they should not be held responsible for this aspect of her claim.

    The trial is set to commence on October 15, 2023. Both parties have a list of witnesses and experts they plan to call to the stand, making this one of the more high-profile personal injury cases in New York City this year.
